She had major surgery on the wound that has not been a success.  the home felt that they could not have her return so her parents decided that they would bring her home.  She sleeps on a hospital bed in the sitting room of their housing association flat.  She has been advised not to get up as her skin is so delicate and needs to have a pump fitted to try and help it heal.  It is a desperate situation for her and her family.  Her mother works full time as a nurse at the hospital and then returns to her home to care for Charlotte through the night. there is little reward in their life, but all try their best to be happy with their situation.  There is a large care package, but this means copious amounts of people in and out of their home each day.  Charlotte is totally reliant on others for all aspect of her daily life.  They are DESPERATE for a holiday.  They have found out about Homeleigh in Carmathenshire that is an adapted holiday cottage that Charlotte could access.  It costs £850 for the use of the cottage and the hoists.  i am asking for £750 for them towards the holiday and £100 towards the cost of the journey.  With Charlotte arriving home, several household items have broken in the home due to increased useage, and so they need to replace the vacuum cleaner.  In order to get a stronger, upright one (to try and save mums back a little) i am also asking for £250 for a new vacuum.  I am appreciative of any support your organisation feel you may be able to offer.

Gofal support people who suffer from Mental Health related illnesses. We provide support and advice to access services and opportunities available to them in the area. We work in partnership with Swansea City Council Tenancy Support Scheme; our role is to offer floating support to tenants who require a higher level of support to be successful in maintaining their tenancies and issues with their mental health. Gofal have been supporting Emma since June 2010, on a weekly basis, mainly at her mother’s property (mother’s address above). Emma previously lived with her husband and young son, but recently this relationship has broken down, following issues regarding domestic abuse. Emma had to flee from her home on 23/03/11 following an argument where the police were called. Emma had to leave with her son and was not able to take any of her possessions with her. Currently, Emma does not own any of her own items and is in desperate need for many items for her new home. Emma states that she has suffered with mental health issues from a young age, and was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS) since the birth of her son. Emma also suffers with anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Emma is currently also going through investigations to look into the possibility that she is experiencing seizures, so Emma states that she is scared when she is left on her own for long periods of time. Support has recently been provided with: - helping Emma to apply independently for housing for her and her young son, assisting Emma with contacting agencies and organisations with change of circumstances, assisting Emma to apply for funding for essential items for her new home, ensuring correct benefit entitlement, as well as emotional support and active listening.  Emma lived at her property in Townhill with her husband for nearly two years prior to their relationship breaking down. While she lived with her husband, Emma stated that her husband was verbally and emotionally abusive to her on a regular basis, which has really affected Emma’s confidence, self esteem and mental health. Gofal referred Emma to Social Services, where she is still currently attending a playgroup with her son, as well as the Freedom Programme. At present, Emma and her young son are staying with Emma’s mother in her spare room, and due to the lack of space Emma is due to move out, hopefully within the next week. Emma has found a private rented property close to her mother, as Emma relies on her mother for a lot of support daily. This will be the first time Emma has lived independently with her young son, and I feel that they both need all the help they can get, as this is an incredibly difficult and emotional time for them both at the moment. I feel that if Emma were awarded the appropriate amount of funding to assist her to purchase these items it would help both her and her son dramatically, and hopefully enable her to feel more confident and independent, and improve her mental health. I hope the information I have provided clarifies how essential  it is for Emma to be awarded funding to be able to purchase items for her home, and how this will benefit her. I hope you are able to look at this letter sympathetically, and get back to us as soon as you can. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at the office on 01792 321390.

We work in partnership with Swansea City Council Tenancy Support Scheme; our role is to offer floating support to tenants who require a higher level of support to be successful in maintaining their tenancies and issues with their mental health. Gofal have been supporting Lynda since August 2009. Support consists of weekly visits to the home. Lynda has suffered from depression, anxiety and panic attacks for a number of years. She rarely leaves her home, and constantly worries about day to day things. Gofal are currently supporting Lynda to access the Community Mental Health Team, where she can receive further support. Gofal are also currently supporting Lynda to report maintenance issues to the home, to maximise benefits, to budget effectively, to apply for items needed for the home, to provide emotional support, as well as ensure Lynda attends all appointments necessary. Lynda is a single lady living alone, as her son is currently in the RAF. She often finds it very difficult to manage financially. She is receiving Income Support and Disability Living Allowance, low rate care and low rate mobility. At present, I am working with Lynda on budgeting, as she does not mange her money effectively, and often will not have enough money to purchase food each week. Lynda is also in debt and is working with support to try to pay these off. I previously applied for funding to enable Lynda to have a short holiday, to visit her son who is in the RAF in Cyprus. Lynda has never been on any kind of holiday before, with or without her son, due to financial issues. I managed to get Lynda some funding towards the flight, but as Lynda has never been on a holiday before she does not have any appropriate clothing for holiday. Lynda struggles financially and she worries that she will not have enough money to get herself some clothing to go away. I feel a short break would also really benefit Lynda, and may help to alleviate some of the stress she has to endure in her everyday life. Therefore, I would like to ask for £200 funding to enable Lynda purchase some clothes for herself. I hope the information I have provided clarifies Lynda’s situation at present, and how this funding would help her in her current situation.

Gofal support people who suffer from Mental Health related illnesses. We provide support and advice to access services and opportunities available to them in the area. We work in partnership with Neath Port Talbot Council Tenancy Support Scheme; our role is to offer floating support to tenants who require a higher level of support to be successful in maintaining their tenancies and issues with their mental health. Gofal have been supporting Donna since January 2011, on a weekly basis at her home which she shares with her partner, Jason, and their two children.  Donna’s youngest child, Courtney, has severe autism, and she is affected in many ways by this. She is unable to speak and is still wearing nappies, but as she is four years old she tends to rip the nappies off and soils the bed and her bed clothes on a daily basis. Donna is also currently pregnant and the baby is due in May 2011. As the baby was not born before 11/04/11, Donna would not be entitled to a maternity grant. As the baby was not planned, Donna and Jason did not keep any of their baby belongings from the other children, so they have nothing for the new baby and are worrying about this. Therefore, I am applying for funding to enable them to purchase a cot and a pram for the baby. Donna is suffering with depression, and at present, is finding it difficult to manage where she is living, as she is isolated.  Donna or Jason have no friends or family in the area, so they receive little help with the children. The couple also struggle to manage financially on times. Support has been provided in order to: - ensure that the couple are receiving the correct benefit entitlement, to apply for a housing transfer, as well as to provide active listening and emotional support. I hope the information I have provided clarifies how beneficial the funding will be for the family. I hope you are able to look at this letter sympathetically and get back to us as soon as you are able to. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at the office on 01792 321390. Yours Sincerely, Leanne JonesCaseworkerFor and on behalf of Gofal ";"2011-04-19 09:30:32";"2011-04-19 09:30:32";"0"

She also experiences on-going pain down the right side of her body which further limits her ability to participate in daily routines. Most significantly however, Mrs Haq experiences impaired speech and comprehension difficulties as a result of her stroke.Mrs Haq has made significant contributions to the local community over the years. Prior to her stroke, had worked hard to establish a distinguished career in community development; employed by the Local authority to work with the Muslim community in the West end where she helped to set up the now well established Muslim centre. Aside from her community activities, she has successfully raised 3 children with her husband and was also caring for her elderly mother prior to her own health deterioration. Having had such an impact of her ability to remain independent, her impairments have also resulted in a gradual deterioration of her self-esteem and self-worth, to the extent that in January of this year, Mrs Haq attempted to take her own life. She is gradually starting to take control of her life, but these circumstances have undoubtedly taken their toll on the rest of the family who now feel they are unable to leave Mrs Haq, previously described as the ‘rock’ of the family, on her own.I am hoping that with your support, the family will be able to secure enough funds to be able to take a family holiday to visit relatives back in Pakistan. The family have not been in a financial position to do this for the last coupe of years and it is felt that such a visit might assist in promoting Mrs Haq motivation and emotional wellbeing. Unfortunately due to changes in the structure of how the Local Authority provide services, we are not in a position to provide ongoing funding for short breaks as we have done in past years.

She wears wrist splints on both arms and has reduced strength in her hands.She also suffers from asthma and diabetes.Assessment of Need:	Karen and her carers report that she sits in a dual motor rise and recline armchair at home with her legs elevated. She spends several hours seated in the armchair throughout the day, and has had seizures where she has been projected forwards and out of the chair, resulting in injury.Karen has been finding her armchair increasingly uncomfortable at home. It doesn’t provide her with enough pelvic or trunk support and she finds that she has to tuck her legs underneath her to give stability. This has led to the following:•	pressure area developing on the outside aspect of her left foot•	external rotation, abduction and forward rotation of her right hip•	build up of pressure through her left hip due to the pelvic obliquity•	compensatory leaning to her right side.Recommendations:	Karen visited the Independent Living Centre to look at chairs that would support her in a better sitting position.Karen is able to adjust her position in an armchair, but feels that she does not always sense the build up of pressure occurring.She is able to transfer independently out of an armchair, but is unable to use the armrests to help push her into standing due to her wrist injuries, so requires a riser mechanism to help her do this. She has supervision from carers with all transfers. Karen requires the following specifications in an armchair to give her the required support and stability:•	Tilt in space action as the leg rest is raised, to provide pelvic stability and reduce the risk of falling forward out of the chair in the event of a seizure. •	Armrest height to give enough lateral support.•	Dual motor feature to allow posture to be altered frequently to redistribute pressure.•	Waterfall back with an additional lateral support flap.•	Soft, wipeable fabric to allow for comfort and cleanliness.The approximate seat dimensions for Karen would be:•	Seat height – 17”•	Seat width – 20”•	Seat depth – 19”Summary:Karen has tried several armchairs in the Independent Living Centre and the PLUSS showroom in Exeter.The chair that would best meet her needs would be an A J Way Arlington Dual Motor tilt in space armchair with the following features;•	Seat height – 17.5 standard•	Seat depth – 19.5 standard•	Seat width – 22.5 (+ 4”)•	Chianti ultra leather fabric•	Waterfall back•	Lateral supports on flap•	Velcro pad for handset on outside of right armrest when sitting.A J Way will give a quote to PLUSS for the above armchair, and Karen will approach charities for assistance with funding.Lucy Clark,Occupational Therapist.";"2011-04-26 13:53:29";"2011-04-26 14:43:27";"0"

The weight continues to decrease but at a slower pace and she is still working towards her ideal weight.

JA214693BSandra is moving today into Ashmore Walk Hanley which is a three-bedroomed property. She has made great efforts to get her life back on track, stemming from going into care at age 14, after childhood abuse.She has been accepted on an Access Course for September 2011, and is currently attending a day a week return to study course, and an Arch training course to become a Domestic Violence Volunteer helper.She has attended a number of education, parenting, Gingerbread family management courses.She is currently living alone but she has weekly contact with two of her three children who are being fostered and can come for overnight visits every weekend, and sees the third one who is fostered and living in Ashbourne 4 times a year.Her long term aim is to reunite the family.Her children's names and ages are:Sonny Simonsen 6.9.94Venus Simonsen 16.7.96Aaron Simonsen 8.9.04She was a heroin addict, then on a methadone programme for 14 years, which she finished 10 months ago.She suffered 19 years of domestic violence with the father of the children, and her children were taken into care 4 years ago.She needs a fridge urgently as she has to refrigerate her medication - Interferon injection for Hepatitis C.She takes Venoflaxin 75mg - having reduced the dose by half from 150mg, and her next review is in July.She was diagnosed over 3 years ago with BPD (Behavioural Personality Disorder).  She was on diazepan previously.Prior to the tenancy starting today she has been in Hope Street Hostel for 2 weeks, and prior to this was in Eastgate for 14 months, a rehabilitation  centre where she completed an alcohol detox.Prior to this she was living rough for about 6 months, and had an unsettled life for some time, with her children going in and out of care.Sandra currently receives Income Support with a Disability Premium, which is £96.35 per week before deductions for a Court Fine and Budgeting Loan (deductions total £19. a week at present).She has added costs for travel for the two children who live in Audley - she has approached Social Services for help with costs - she does not want to do this but we have advised that she needs to consider this to enable her to budget for other urgent items she needs.She has mobile phone costs to keep in touch with the children.We are requesting that Social Fund direct deductions be lowered, and are awaiting a response to this.She has had a Community Care Grant award of £500, she did not have this with her today and says she is being helped to ask for a review by Hannah, her support worker at Chepstow House.The request was for items totalling £2162.She would like help to apply for items through charity funding.She is spending the £500 on: fridge, microwave, bed for herself and bedding, towels, kettle + kitchen items,  radio.She needs further funding for: cooker, washing machine, 2 single beds and bedding for 2 children who are to visit and stay over,  and carpets for 2 children's bedrooms, stairs and front room.We intend to approach the League of the Helping Hand for a cooker, RLG Charity Trust for a washer, and have asked the Rowley Trust to consider a grant for 2 single beds for the children, and perhaps some carpeting if possible.If you were able to consider a grant for carpeting that would be much appreciated.Sandra is currently being supported by the Chepstow House Project, funded by the Ministry of Justice, to help women at risk of offending and ex-offenders.We will be discussing with her at a future appointment if she has grounds TO apply for DLA.Sandra can be contacted on 07756247786 if you should wish to call her - she is in agreement to this.She attends college all day Mondays, and on a Wednesday is only available after 2.00pm due to the DV volunteer training course.You can contact Jane Birdsey, Outreach worker, either at Hanley CAB on 01782 408686, or at Chepstow House on 01782 208200 (11.00am – 2.00pm), if you want further information.";"2011-05-18 16:37:20";"2011-05-18 16:37:21";"0"

She arrived here as a refugee in 1997 after fleeing the conflicts in the Congo. She received indefinite leave to remain in 2007.  As an asylum seeker she was unable to work officially but did complete a MTI training in massage at Shoreditch College in 2000.  She volunteered here, at the Cara trust, from 2004-2007 giving massages to service users.  She also volunteered at other voluntary agencies.  She stopped volunteering when she became pregnant with her son Maurice who is now four years old.  Koni met Maurice’s father through an HIV support group and they got married.  She, her husband and son lived in Fulham.  However the marriage had difficulties and although Koni tried to get marriage counselling and involve her husband he would not participate.  She left her husband and went to a women’s refuge who were able to get her re-housed in Tottenham. She finds it very difficult to talk about her marital relationship as she suffered a lot of mental and emotional abuse and did not want to go into details as she became too upset.As a young woman living in The Congo, Komi went to university to study medicine.  The Civil war and uprising interrupted her studies and for two years no course ran because of a student strike.  She did however practice nursing and mid-wiffry when she was not at university and has always wanted to pursue some work in the medical field.  However when she was diagnosed HIV she was advised that she should not go into the field.  Never the less she is now investigating on how she can full fill her ambition by planning a way to study nursing.Komi needs a bed: from Argos this would cost £254for frame and mattress.   Her current bed is broken.  She also needs a chest of drawers as she does not have anywhere to put her or her son’s clothes. From Argos  this would const in the region of £55.

Together with her husband and daughter she moved to London in 1994, whilst her parents remained in Portugal. Ramila’s husband died in 1995. In 2000, following a period of illness, Ramila was diagnosed with HIV, which was probably contracted in Mozambique some years previously. Ramila’s father died in Lisbon in 2009, which left her profoundly depressed. She felt unable to attend his funeral due to that depression. Ramila first came to Cara in 2010 and regularly attends our women’s peer support group. She also has weekly sessions with our Cognitive Behavioural Therapist as part of her attempts to break her cycle of depression. What is needed.Ramila has asked us to help her raise the money to pay for a flight to Portugal to visit her mother and her father’s grave. She would like to travel in August if possible as that is Hindu holy month. She hasn’t been able to visit her mother since 2008, as her depression and poverty meant she felt unable to do so. We feel that a visit to her mother may well have a significant impact on how Ramila now feels about herself, and her guilty feelings for not being able to attend her father’s funeral.Funds requiredBA return flight to Lisbon = £322.Food and living expenses whilst away = £100.Total = £422.Other charities approachedAs this required amount is a lot to ask of 1 charity we are spreading our request across a number of charities: Mary MacArthur Holiday Trust, Ibero-American Benevolent Society; South London Relief-in-Sickness Fund; Margaret’s Fund and Society of Friends of Foreigners in Distress.If you require additional information please contact me as above.Please make any cheque payable to Cara Trust.";"2011-06-18 13:32:03";"2011-06-18 13:32:04";"0"

Her application for leave to remain in this country has been with the Home Office for a number of years.She was diagnosed with HIV in 2005 for which she takes anti HIV medication; this is managing the virus well. The biggest impact of HIV for Grace has been related to the stigma associated with the virus, and the attendant discrimination from others, rather than the effects of the virus itself.Grace also suffers with diabetes, which is controlled with medication. This obviously impacts on her diet, meaning she has to try to avoid sugar filled cheap/junk foods.Grace also has asthma and high blood pressure.She also has problems associated with an enlarged heart – whilst this is largely controlled with medication it can occasionally have a significant impact on her life, with symptoms similar to heart attack.She is currently studying numeracy, English, Maths and IT at City & Guild level, and has passed all modules so far. Grace is planning to enrol on an Access to Nursing course in autumn 2011 – at Lambeth Morley College.This application is for a cheap laptop and MS office software for students, to both enable and encourage Grace with her studies as she seeks to carve out a new life for herself.";"2011-06-22 18:50:50";"2011-06-22 18:50:50";"0"

Her second pregnancy had complications and she was treated with a number of drugs and had to have an early caesarean operation. Her daughter Lynn was under the care of Great Ormond Street until she was 11 years old as she has the condition Pre-mature Sexual Maturation (PSM). The condition calls for extra clothes and shoes as she outgrows and wears them out rapidly as well as an organic diet, both of which have a major impact on Ann’s budget.Ann has never worked as she suffers from severe bouts of depression and because her health is not robust due to her HIV.  She suffers from regular night sweats, becomes tired easily and has repeated chest infections as well as a persistent cough.  In 2008 Ann had an operation to tighten her bladder as she is incontinent.  Unfortunately the operation was not a success and she is still being seen by consultants and is undergoing further investigation.  Her incontinence is causing Ann a lot of distress and cost as she has to pay for extra laundry and pads.Last year she also had to undergo x-rays and investigation for a chest condition, which has been diagnosed as a form of pneumonia, for which she had to take still more medication.Recently Anne’s life chances have started to improve, and she has almost completed a Health Psychology Masters at Westminster University, with a view to hopefully looking for work in this field once she has graduated.What is needed.This application is for funds for a new bed and mattress for Ann. Owing to her incontinence and night-sweats Ann’s bed and mattress are very soiled.A new bed-frame / bed-stead would cost £287. A new mattress would cost £579Total: £866As this is a large amount we are applying to a number of charities for assistance. Therefore this application is for £200Other charities approachedFor additional contributions we have also applied to United Charities of St Paul, Strand Parishes Trust and Hyde Park Place Estate Charity.";"2011-07-12 17:09:53";"2011-07-13 17:33:50";"0"

She was referred to our support agency by the HIV specialist midwife during her pregnancy with her child, Lucy. LASS have supported her regarding living with HIV, including help with practical needs, emotional support and advocacy regarding asylum and subsistence needs. I have included below some information that may give an insight into the HIV virus that Miss Bandura is living with. HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus attacks the body’s immune system. A person with the virus can look and feel perfectly well for many years and may not even know they are infected. If they are tested and do not receive anti-retroviral treatment for the virus it is highly likely that the HIV will break down the person’s immune system. When this happens, you may become vulnerable to illnesses that a healthy immune system would normally be able to fight off. As the immune system weakens and becomes less able to fight back, these illnesses (referred to as opportunistic infections) may become more frequent and severe. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It is a collection of infections (usually severe) and cancers that may develop in people who are HIV positive. A person is said to have AIDS when they have developed one of these specific illnesses. Some people will receive an AIDS diagnosis when their T-cell (a type of immune cell that HIV damages) count drops below 200 copies per ml of blood. Miss Bandura is living well with HIV, however her current medication produces several side effects. These include feeling dizzy, migraines, tiredness, swelling, muscle spasms, photosensitivity and nausea etc. After years of waiting for a positive decision on her claim for asylum from Zimbabwe, Grace was finally granted full refugee status from the Home Office in May 2009. She applied for Leicester City Council housing and has lived in her current two bedroomed maisonette for nearly two years. Grace gave birth to her second child in September 2010 and applied to the council for a transfer to a ground floor property as she currently has to climb two flights of outside stairs to get to her maisonette above a shopping prescient. She has been granted a move to a ground floor two bedroom flat close by and she is thrilled. She is living on a very low income and struggles with weekly outgoings and has little disposable income in order to buy large items for the house. For some time her second hand electric cooker stopped working. The oven part of the cooker still works however the electric hob no longer works. She would like to buy herself a new cooker, but needs some financial assistance toward the overall cost. If you are able to help at all your assistance would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me on the number above.

We would like you to consider Ms Quresh’s application on the information provided below. Ms Quresh was originally referred to our service by her social worker, she had a number of health issues including long term chronic blood conditions and alongside she has other health issues like chronic pain in the knees and the back, chest pains and leukaemia which prevents her from being employed and therefore has to rely on benefits to sustain a near normal living and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. But the benefits she is receiving which is presently only Income Support is not enough for her to maintain a home. She has not been able to afford to buy the basic necessities in her household because she is not financially stable and also because of her many health conditions which are life limiting. She must eat healthily and take a lot of medication in order to maintain her health. The most concerning thing was that this is bringing a lot of stress and pressure to Ms Quresh and she has already been identified as suffering from chronic depression. We have supported her and will continue to offer the practical support until she has the basic items in order for a basic standard of living that anyone can expect.  Failure of this plan would mean Ms Quresh continuing to suffer from depression and her health may become worse due to not having the basic necessities. Having a washing machine will allow Ms Quresh to attend to her own hygiene standards without having to rely on the neighbours and it will also allow her to maintain her dignity and reduce minimise the pain that she currently has in her knees and back. The item requested by Ms Quresh I believe is essential and reasonable. Please don’t hesitate to contact me should you require further information. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.Yours SincerelyPamela T. MahakaSpecialist Support WorkerForwards Project";"2011-07-21 16:21:17";"2011-07-21 16:21:17";"0"

Tammy is currently being seen by Beaconsfield (mental Health) for Depression – on medication (Methadone script), split personality disorder, stress, self harm and is also being seen by the LPFT substance Misuse Team at Addaction here in Grantham (Tammy was also a street drinker). I work with Tammy to support her independence, offer housing advice and guidance to try to resolve any issues and to get her into safe, permanent housing. Tammy was living in a HMO, sharing the bathroom and kitchen facilities at 63 Edward Street in Grantham. Tammy has 2 children living in Boston, which is about 30 miles from Grantham; she can see them at weekends and school holidays. However they were unable to come to the property as there was no room in her bedsit and due to the nature of the other tenants and drug use, it had been deemed unwise to allow children to visit her at the property. It has been advised that Tammy needs to find balance in her life and feels lost without seeing her children. Tammy would like to see her children more regularly but feels that her current abode is totally unsuitable.We have recently moved Tammy into a new 2 bed roomed accommodation although we used up most funding on her deposit via CCG and Budgeting loan and funding from the Vicar’s relief fund. Tammy has been able to look after herself better (she has quit street drinking) and children and has continued to rebuild the bridges between herself and children . At present we have managed to support Tammy with certain brown furniture but she is still without a washing machine.Please could you help her with your support regards Richard Bernard, Housing Support Officer";"2011-12-09 09:37:31";"2011-12-09 09:37:31";"0"

These conditions impact upon Mrs Freeman’s ability to carry out activities of daily living meaning she is dependent on support to get dressed, washed and prepare meals throughout the day. Her asthma limits the distance she is safely able to mobilise without becoming breathless and similarly heightened experience of pain in her joints restricts her mobility. In addition, Mrs Freeman is registered as partially blind (tunnel vision) and experiences some hearing loss, both of which again impact upon her ability to remain independent. Her physical deterioration over the years has unfortunately affected her mood and motivation which has had the knock on affect of causing great distress and concern amongst her adult children who also provide a certain amount of informal care in addition to paid carers.I am hoping that with your support, Mrs Freeman will be able to secure enough funds to be able to take a holiday with paid care formal carers. Mrs Freeman is not currently in a position to finance a holiday independently and it is felt that a break in a reasonably hot climate would assist in alleviating some of Mrs Freeman’s physical pain as well as promoting her motivation and emotional wellbeing. Unfortunately due to changes in the structure of how the Local Authority provide services, we are not in a position to provide ongoing funding for short breaks as we have done in past years.

Mrs Jones has had asthma for at least 20 years.  After a fall at work around 15 years ago she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and more recently osteoarthritis.  Mrs Jones was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in her 40s.  The diabetes was controlled with tablets, but insulin is prescribed now.  Last year she had a partial amputation of her foot and toes as a result of the progress of the condition.  Coronary heart disease was diagnosed four years ago and Mrs Jones has a history of mini strokes and falls.  As a result of her health problems, Mrs Jones experiences joint pain, mobility problems , fluctuating blood sugar levels, and continence problems.Mrs Jones lives alone in a house rented from a local social landlord.  A stair lift has been installed and a commode supplied for use downstairs.  Mrs Jones has a Care on Call pendant to summon help in emergencies.  Her daughter lives nearby and helps her daily with showering, changing dressings, putting on clothing, managing medication, managing diet, meal preparation,  attending medical appointments, emotional and social support.  Mrs Jones is unable to go out alone and uses the high rate mobility component of her Disability Living Allowance to fund a Motability car which is driven by her daughter.The carpet in Mrs Jones’s hall, stairs, landing, living room and bedroom is worn thin, uneven and in need of replacement.  She has lived in the house for over 30 years and the stair carpet has been down for at least 20 years.  The living room carpet was second-hand more than nine years ago and the bedroom carpet was in such poor condition after continence problems that it has been taken up and the floor left bare for more than a year.  Mrs Jones needs replacement carpet to improve insulation, help to reduce the cost of heating, as a safer surface to break a fall, to enable use of a wheeled trolley to move food and drinks which she is unable to carry, and to improve the appearance of her living environment and boost morale.  Mrs Jones is unable to apply for a Community Care Grant as she does not get a qualifying benefit and has been turned down for a Crisis Loan.  Her income is solely from state benefits and is very limited so she is unable to save up to buy carpet.  A quote for the cost of supplying carpet, underlay and fitting has been obtained and can be supplied.  Other applications have been made towards the funding of this item, and the outcomes are pending.	";"2011-08-24 12:44:31";"2011-08-24 12:44:31";"0"

Ms. Waddup is currently living alone in privately rented accommodation following a separation from her husband. She is in full time employment and not in receipt of any benefits. Her husband left her in sole charge of the repayment of joint debts and does not contribute any money. Ms. Waddup has been granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK, but her three children are still in Zimbabwe as she cannot afford the visas to bring them here. They are being looked after by Ms. Waddup's aunt. Ms. Waddup sends £505 every three months to pay for her children’s school fees, plus extra money towards items such as school uniforms, books and food when she can afford to.Ms. Waddup's income is too low for her to manage all her daily living expenses, expenses, including rent, food, cleaning supplies, council tax, utility bills, and her debt repayments. Ms. Waddup’s accommodation is very sparsely furnished. She has a bed and kitchen essentials, but cannot afford to buy a sofa or any other furniture. She never invites any company into her home, as she is embarrassed at what she has been unable to afford.Ms. Waddup is HIV positive and suffers from depression. She needs to have an operation on her abdomen, but she is not currently healthy enough to safely undergo general anaesthetic. She struggles to adhere to her medication, and she suffers from memory problems, so she has also been referred to a psychologist. She must frequently travel to appointments for checkups and to collect medication. It is essential that she attends these appointments in order to effectively manage her health, but they add to her living expenses, and Ms. Waddup often has to miss appointments. This hinders the necessary improvement of her health, and therefore causes further delays to an important operation. Ms. Waddup’s current situation causes her a great deal of emotional distress, which has a negative impact on her fragile physical and mental health conditions. I kindly request that you consider awarding Ms. Waddup a grant of £300 to enable her to purchase a sofa, and to help her meet everyday living expenses. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached by post at Bradbury House, 7 Lowe Street, Camp Hill, Birmingham, B12 0ER, by telephone on 0121 766 5444, and by email at JemmaStephens@redcross.org.uk.

She studied for and passed her BSC Applied Chemistry at Greenwich University and then worked as a Quality Control Chemist for Glaxo Smithkline.Olu's mother died in 2003, which was the catalyst for depression to set in; Olu continues to suffer from poor mental health to this day. This eventually resulted in her having to stop working.In 2006 she was diagnosed with HIV, which she feels also affects her mental health.Olu also suffers from back pain and sciatica, which strarted when she was working, due to the long hours standing up. She had an MRI scan which revealed a slipped disc in her lower back, for which she now takes anti-inflamatories and pain killers. She also has regular Osteopathy sessions.Olu has major concerns about her fertility as she would love to have children. Given her age and the onset of pre-menopause symptoms, she feels that her chances are slipping away, which increases her sadness and mental health issues.As a result of these problems she sees little likelihood that she wil be able to work in the foreseeable future.What is needed.Olu was moved from temporary furnished accommodation to a permanent 1 bedroom unfurnished Housing Association flat 2 years ago. Since then she has struggled to get sufficient furniture and equipment together. It was only on overhearing this that at one of our support groups that we offered to help olu with this, as she didn't realise that help might be available. Clearly, given her income, Olu is unable to afford to buy necessary items to help improve her quality of life.We feel that a laptop computer will enble her to communicate, via Skype, with her family in Nigeria, as well as help maintain her IT skills. This might be particularly useful when Olu is suffering from intense depression - when she is less able to leave home or meet with friends.";"2011-09-03 14:19:10";"2011-09-03 14:19:11";"0"

I am currently supporting Miss Paula Sheppard. I am writing to you to request a grant of £250 on her behalf. Miss Sheppard was admitted to hospital in Birmingham on 19.03.2011and diagnosed with PCP and HIV. Miss Sheppard was transferred to another hospital on 16.04.2011, and then the to a rehabilitation centre on 21.05.2011. Miss Sheppard was discharged on 25.07.2011 but had nowhere to go, as her flat had burned down shortly before her hospitalization. She therefore submitted a Homeless Application and was offered emergency accommodation at Breedon Road Homeless Centre, which is where she is currently living. This accommodation is fully furnished, and is being provided by Birmingham City Council until Miss Sheppard secures permanent accommodation on Birmingham City Council’s Home Choice website. Miss Sheppard is still taking antibiotics as part of her recovery from PCP (Pneumocystis Pneumonia), and her mobility is very limited. She has applied for Disability Living Allowance, but this is still being processed. At the moment her only income is from Incapacity Benefit. Miss Sheppard is in receipt of Housing Benefit, but there is a shortfall which she must meet herself. She therefore has to pay £25 per week towards her accommodation at the homeless centre. The rent includes gas, electricity and water rates. Miss Sheppard’s contributions also include repayments towards a previous overpayment of Housing Benefit. Due to her medical conditions, it is extremely important that Miss Sheppard eats regular healthy meals. As she became severely underweight when she became ill, Miss Sheppard is prescribed 40 Sips to increase her weight.As the accommodation in which Miss Sheppard lived before she was admitted to hospital burned down, Miss Sheppard lost all her personal possessions, including clothes and household appliances. She has been able to purchase some items of clothing, but these are now too small because she is getting back to a healthy weight. Miss Sheppard currently manages to meet her daily living expenses of travel, rent and food, but she does not have enough money left over to purchase clothes for herself in new sizes. I am writing to request that you consider awarding Miss Sheppard a grant of £250 for clothes, and to put towards household essentials when she moves to permanent accommodation. I hope all of the above is satisfactory. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached by post at Bradbury House, 7 Lowe Street, Camp Hill, Birmingham, B12 0ER, by telephone on 0121 766 5444, or by email at JemmaStephens@redcross.org.uk.

I did not complete the section asking what the money was needed for, it is needed to purchase a sofa as the one they are using is partly collapsed and threadbare.I have been working with Maxine as her support worker for about one year and she is a single mum of a nine year old boy ,with no friends or family to support her. She suffers from extreme depression and anxiety and suffers from panic attacks. Earlier this year her mental health was so bad she had to attend the day hospital mental heath ward for 4 weeks as they could not admit her as her son would have needed to  go into care.Her elderly mother suffers from Alzheimer’s and is in a residential nursing home and will not be returning to the family home. Maxine has recently superseded her mothers tenancy and the whole home needs to be decorated, updated and new  furniture purchased due to the extremely poor condition of her mothers possessions that were left at the house.A condition of her superseding her mothers tenancy is that she continues to receive support from Gofal and that she works in line with  an action plan with her housing officer to get things completed. If she does not achieve this, she could become homeless with her son.If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me on 01792 321390.Yours Sincerely,Linda White,Gofal";"2011-09-14 11:31:37";"2011-09-14 11:31:37";"0"

She has no family support and suffers with depression following physical violence abuse in childhood.  She has periods of binge eating and finds it difficult to socialise. Although she is claiming JSA she has problems mixing and may struggle to find work at present.She has been referred for help and support from the Chepstow House Project, part of Brighter Futures Housing Association in Hanley to encourage her to access a range of support on an individual and group basis.Job Seekers Allowance is her only income, with full Council Tax and Housing Benefit.  If Lucy was found suitable for an award from yourselves it would be arranged for a Chepstow House support worker to accompany her to buy items and obtain a receipt for items purchased.Other charity applications: We are applying to the Newby Trust to ask for consideration for the grant of a washing machine as Lucy does not have one and struggles to find the money for laundrette costs. In addition to the debts listed she is having direct deductions of £18 per week from benefit towards arrears of Severn Trent Water and for a Social Fund loan - we have written to ask for current balances for these.We have advised that a DRO (Debt Relief Order) as soon as possible would be the best long term solution for Miss Hollis to deal with her debts and increase her available income.  She is keen to go for this option to deal with her debts, and is attempting to save towards this but this is difficult for her in her current circumstances which include priority debts, especially with rising fuel costs and winter approaching. We have applied to the Dibs Charity for help with the £90 cost of this, and Lucy will attempt to save towards this amount.";"2011-10-10 10:30:37";"2011-10-10 10:30:37";"0"

The scoliosis means that walking is almost impossible, leaving her mobility greatly limited.  R has a love of the outdoors and cycling and enjoys the freedom and joy that this brings.  R has been assessed for a specialist trike to allow her to cycle, allowing her to experience the world in the way that other teens do.

This simple activity that many of us take for granted improves R confidence, self-esteem and mental health.  This simple activity will help her positively towards adulthood and the challenges that this will bring.     Unfortunately, this freedom costs around £700.

I feel that Beverley should be eligible for help from the Margaret’s Fund due to the exceptional pressures that have been put on her and her family over the last few years.LASS first became involved with the family in the year 2000, after Ms Beverley Msimbe and her son Dylan Seymour were both diagnosed HIV positive. This was understandably a huge shock for the family. They were referred to LASS and since then we have we have supported the family regarding living well with HIV, including practical and emotional support, advice for claiming eligible benefits and advocacy regarding subsistence needs. Both Beverley and Dylan live well with HIV. Beverley experiences other health problems such as chronic rheumatoid arthritis, high blood pressure, chronic respiratory problems, low mobility and depression. She suffers from a damaging side effect from her anti-retroviral medication for HIV called lipodystrophy. This means that fat has redistributed on her body and she has abnormally large hump on the back of her neck, arms and breasts. She is very self conscious of this. She requires assistance with personal care on a daily basis from her partner, Paul who is HIV negative. In August 2009 Paul was made redundant after 22 years of work. This was hard for the family as his was the main income coming into the household. He was pleased though as he wanted to spend more time with Beverley and become her full time carer as her health was affecting her in such a way that she needs attention through out the day also. I helped the family apply for the appropriate benefits however whilst the family were waiting for payment they had to use their overdraft facility on their bank accounts. Paul has since received his redundancy settlement, an issue that has been going on for nearly a year. However it went some of the way to clearing the overdraft. In Christmas 2009, Beverley was rushed to hospital with a serious blood clot on her lung. She was admitted into the Glenfield hospital and her situation was critical. This put exceptional pressure on the family.  Since 2009 the family have been redecorating the family home, which is a council property that the family have lived in for over 10 years. They wanted the property to feel more comfortable and welcoming as they both spend a lot of their time at home due to Beverley’s problems with mobility. Although Beverley and Paul are receiving the correct benefits for their situation, it does not leave much in the way of disposable income as their health costs mean the family have extra expenses. Therefore we are applying to the Margaret’s Fund to help with the last room that needs redecorating. Beverley is selfless, she has made sure that her family are cared for and left her bedroom the last to be decorated, when she is probably the most in need. At present her and Paul’s room is no where near the standard needed for Beverley to feel well in. We are appealing to the fund to help Paul and Beverley but a new mattress and bed frame. It is important for Beverley to be comfortable in bed as she has to wear an oxygen mask at all times throughout the night and her medication prevents her from sleeping well. At present their bed is so old (a hand me down from an Aunt), the mattress is extremely thin and does not offer enough support to her or Paul. Due to Beverley’s weight she needs a good supportive mattress and so this is the item that will cost. I am unsure as to how much financial support you can help Paul and Beverley but any assistance will be gratefully received. I hope you will look kindly on this family’s application.

She was referred to our support agency in March 2008 by the HIV specialist midwife during her pregnancy. LASS have supported her regarding living with HIV, including help with practical needs, emotional support and advocacy regarding subsistence needs. Shortly after giving birth to Luke in July 2008, Abigail fell pregnant with her second child. Abigail gave birth to Souzie in June 2009. She then gave birth to a third child in December 2010 to a little boy, Sammy. Having these three children so close together has presented Abigail and her partner with financial difficulties. Abigail’s husband Melusi; has been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK from Zimbabwe. Abigail is a dependant on his visa. Until May 2011 Melusi was working in a temporary job and the family had a stable income. After becoming unemployed Melusi applied for Jobseekers Allowance, unfortunately he is not entitled to receive Jobseekers Allowance as he did not contribute enough National Insurance in the last financial year to award him with the benefit and so has to sign on fortnightly but does not receive any income, therefore they relay on Child Benefit and Tax credit payments.  They are waiting on a decision from Housing and Council Tax Benefit. Abigail gave birth to her fourth child, a baby boy on 4th November 2011. The family currently live in a one bed flat which is extremely damp and cramped as they all share one bedroom, which is not suitable considering the health needs of the family. With this new arrival the family is facing harder financial pressures. Fortunately they have been awarded a three bedroom property on the New Parks estate of Leicester. The family are thrilled however are extremely worried as they have no furniture to take with them apart from the children’s beds and cots. As they have been in a private rented furnished accommodation they do not have their own cooker, washing machine or fridge/freezer. Abigail is very worried how she is going to manage without these items and four very young children. We are appealing to the Margaret’s fund to help Abigail in acquiring a cooker. I hop you kind kindly on this family’s application. Yours sincerely, Lucy Ball Direct Services Support and Advocacy Worker ";"2011-11-15 12:29:25";"2011-11-15 12:29:25";"0"

Her ex-partner was put on remand.She therefore needs a number of household items: flooring throughout the property, a washing machine, a tumble dryer, and fridge freezer.She has been seen at the CAB Outreach at Chepstow House, a Ministry of Justice funded project to help women at risk of offending and ex-offenders.  Chepstow House have assisted her to find alternative housing, which is Council, and supported her through this difficult time.She has recently received our help to claim ESA in her name, and change her claim for Tax Credits.

She came to London a number of years ago; fleeing religious and social persecution in her native Zambia.Maureen has been a user of this charity’s services for over 12 years, as well as a community support volunteer for 5 years and formerly a Trustee. She is 37, lives in London borough of Camden, and works full time as a Civil Servant with the Ministry of Defence. Maureen has been living with HIV for many years, for which she currently takes a complex regime of anti HIV medications. We’ve been really pleased to be able to help Maureen progress from the situation of solely being a service user, to volunteering with us, to training for employment and getting a job, and then finally serving as a Trustee for Cara.6 years ago Maureen was granted 3 years limited leave to remain by the Home Office, which was followed up in 2008 with another 3 years limited leave to remain. Recently the Home Office decided to award her unlimited leave to remain in the UK, a decision with which Maureen is thrilled.However, there is a financial cost – a payment of £972 – see highlighted on attached Home Office document.Unfortunately Maureen lives on a low wage and, due to her immigration status, has been unable to claim Housing or Council Tax Benefit, and so has been unable to save toward this fee. Clearly this is very good news for Maureen – she just needs a little help in gathering the funds together for the fee.As a result this application is for £250 towards helping Maureen achieve her goals and continuing to work and make her life in London.";"2011-12-21 15:00:28";"2011-12-21 15:00:28";"0"

She is 53 years of age and lives in Lancaster. We have recently processed a Disabled Facilities Grant Application for her following a referral from Occupational Services. Following the required means test the client is has been assessed as liable for a personal contribution of £1500.00 towards a stairlift and walk in shower adaptations costing in total approximately £7k to assist her in managing her condition.The requirement for a client contribution is due to her age and the fact that her husband is still currently working although this may change as her condition worsens. Her husband's income provides the only income for them other than a DLA contribution. The family has no savings left and is unable to pay their assessed contribution. There is also a major concern for Mr & Mrs Calvert that should Mr Calvert have to cease work their house may be at risk. There is very limited heating in the home, Mr & Mrs Calvert attempt to balance their budget by minimising the use of heating despite the fact that this is can cause difficulties for her breathing. Coughing spasms have caused her to lose control of her bladder and rectal functions.This is an acute COPD condition, the client will shortly be on oxygen for 100% of the day and this is a progressive illness and I appeal for your assistance in making her living conditions less onerous.I represent the Home Improvement Agency run by Lancaster City Council and, as well as administering the DFG grant, our remit is to assist those who do not have the means to enable them to live at home.I can provide many more details if required, this lady is enduring much suffering and discomfort and this is an acute problem for her and her family.Mrs Calvert receives some support from her family mainly through in form of care. There is very limited financial support available, the family are not in a position to assist due to their own financial circumstances.

That has made her feel quite lonely, Laptop is the only thing she has that she feels she can communicate with others and also help her stay in touch with the outside world as she has not socialised for almost a year now. She also keeps track of her banking and paying her bills through online payments.  Unfortunately since December 2011 she has had no laptop and is requiring some help if it can be provided through your company, it is the 1st time that I am using your company and hope that you will be able to provide her some help as soon as possible.

She has also been giving her Elderly People tuition, in particular with emails, how to send them and read them. Sadly, her Computer crashed. I have tried, in vain, to get it repaired.

Rowena has Fibromyalgia, and spinal damage and has sever mobility problems as a result, she also suffers from Bi polar disorder and is vulnerable from feeling suicidal.  She has high levels of pain and depression for which she takes medication. Her daughter Eden has been diagnosed with ADHD, and their relationship is often difficult and strained.  As a result of Rowena’s medical condition and the poor state of the family home, Eden often spends time at her two maternal Aunties homes.Rowena has requested funding towards a new fridge freezer as the one in the home is in a poor state, a new single bed for Eden and a double bed for herself.  At present Rowena is sleeping on the sofa downstairs and there is a single mattress upstairs for Eden.   The family are also in need of a wardrobe and a hoover, and they have no carpets in the hall stairs or kitchen.  Rowena’s health and medication are now stable and she is optimistic about the future, she has a care package in place provided by the local authority to assist with her personal care, and household tasks and a support worker takes her out twice a week, as Rowena is unable to go out without assistance. She has a number of debts which she is paying back on a regular basis and desperately wants to improve her situation and provide a secure home and care for her daughter.

She can only walk short distances using a walking aid and she has a manual wheel chair for outside the home.  Vicky cannot use public transport so uses taxi’s which are wheel chair friendly, they use this for the weekly food shop and any medical or school appointments, but this is expensive.

Her priority is a cooker and a fridge freezer, she also needs bunk beds for her two daughters.  They have tried to purchase a cooker second hand but the grill doesn’t work the oven is faulty and they can only use the gas rings.  The fridge freezer they have is also second hand, and has shelves missing and rust in areas, the seal is also damaged.  Vicky’s two daughters currently share a room they have only 1 bed between them and a mattress on the floor, this totally fills there bedroom and bunk beds would mean they had more space.  The family struggle financially and would appreciate any help you can offer towards these essential household items. ";"2012-03-23 16:20:34";"2012-03-23 16:20:34";"0"

She shut herself away, stopped taking her medication and began self-harming. She has been hospitalised many times because of the injuries she has caused and has slowly been persuaded to start taking her medication again. She has also begun engaging with her GP and has begun to address her self-harming. Donna is hopeful that she will also soon receive the support of a psychiatrist.As Donna's poor mental health has been such a focus for the last 3 years she has neglected her flat and never found cooking faciltiles for the property. He GP has advised her to start cooking as a way to relax but also to ensure she is eating properly and keeping her mind and body healthy. Sadly Donna does not have the money to pay a cooker and has been refused a community care grant. I would be very grateful if you could consider her for a one-off grant to cover the cost of a new cooker and installation.";"2012-03-27 13:43:51";"2012-03-27 13:55:39";"0"

When she left her partner she continued to struggle with these issues but also faced a long-period of homelessness during which she sofa-surfed around friends and family’s houses. While homeless Stephanie was encouraged to seek help and tentatively approached her GP. They diagnosed her with depression and anxiety and also spoke to her about her drug use. She agreed to take anti-depressants for her mental health and start a methadone prescription to substitute her drug use. She has continued to see her GP every month for regular check-ups and thankfully all aspects of her health are beginning to improve. Stephanie’s next step to getting her life back on track was to end her homelessness and gain a permanent tenancy. This happened in September last year and since this time she has been trying to source the household essentials she needs to turn her house into a home. Using the help of friends, family and local furniture projects Stephanie has managed to get nearly everything she needs apart from a washing machine. She is currently using a nearby laundrette to clean her clothes but this is costing her a lot of money and she does not feel properly independent as she has to rely on others.We are able to provide her with a new washing machine (including installation) for £249. I would be very grateful if you could consider her for a one-off grant to cover this cost.";"2012-04-17 12:16:29";"2012-04-17 12:16:30";"0"

As she had no furniture or white goods of  her own she received assistance from Dr Edwards and Bishop Kings, a charity that can assist Fulham residents. They helped her to the maximum level they were able to for this year. She applied for a crisis loan which was refused as she is in receipt of Incapacity benefit only. Ms Coll did not realise that she had an entitlement to an Income Support top up to her benefit since her DLA award increased to HR care; her CPN assisted with this application as she used to receive LRC but her condition has deteriorated. She did not realise this higher award would lead to an increase in other benefits so we are assisting with this and have applied for IS for her; we are waiting for confirmation of what her award will be. There is no flooring in Ms Colls flat, i advised her to get a quote from a local carpet shop, the quote for the bedroom, sitting, room and hallway was £800-£900. I did advise Ms Coll this would be to high an amount to request and she did understand that of course. She would greatly appreciate any help you could give her so at least she would be able to get either the sitting room or bedroom floor covered with carpet. Ms Coll advises the flat is cold due to the bare floors. I have just referred Ms Coll to social services as she hopes to get direct payments so she can get a carer to help her; as a result of her condition her son had to be placed into foster care, she visits him twice a week which is the highlight of her week. Any help the Margarets Fund can offer Ms Coll will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much indeed. ";"2012-04-17 16:00:55";"2012-04-17 16:00:55";"0"

Juliet is 32 years old and came from Nigeria in 2009 on a student visa. She was diagnosed HIV positive in 2009 when she was pregnant. She lives in Enfield.She attends the positively women group at the Cara Trust and is a well liked member of the group. She has 2 children, a son who is 2 years old and a daughter who is 1 years old. They all live together in one bedroom in her friend’s house, which is not an ideal situation but is thankfully stable for now. Her only means of financial support is from the kindness of her friends, and occasionally but very infrequently from her ex-husband. Juliet currently has £0 income as her student visa expired in October 2011 after she completed her Masters in Management at London Metropolitan University, so she is no longer allowed to work to support herself and as she has no legal status she has no recourse to public funds, and is literally destitute.Her ex-husband left her and the children when she discovered she was HIV positive, giving her no support at such a difficult time and leaving her to raise the children alone. Although he still has contact with the children albeit infrequently, he provides very little, if any, financial support.Juliet is very well educated, in addition to the Masters above she also has a BSc in Banking & Finance from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, one of the five elite universities in the country. Juliet would love to work here to support herself and her family, however in order to do this she needs to apply for indefinite leave to remainHer solicitor has been working on an application to the Home Office for indefinite leave to remain on medical and human rights grounds. However, the Home Office has returned the application form as they say she needs to pay an application fee of £561. As I stated above Juliet has no income and no means to obtain the money for the application fee. The Home Office has also stated she does not fall within any of the categories in order for them to waive the fee.  If we can submit the application to the Home Office we would then be able to support Juliet by making a swift application to the National Asylum Support Service, which would enable her to support herself and the children whilst her application was considered.";"2012-04-20 11:27:43";"2012-04-20 11:27:43";"0"

Ms. Bloomfield moved into her fathers home to take care of him when her mother died. She lives with her father in his home with her five children. Susan is a single parent with a very streched income, she struggles financially and cannot get support from family or friends. Ms. Bloomfield is reliant on a mobility scooter and as a result struggles to maintain the standard of the home. The house is falling apart, fixtures and fittings are loose, kitchen counter tops worn down, leakages, wallpaper falling, carpet is comig away from the floor and starting to smell. The family are receiving support from Hackney Family Intervention Project and all their issues stem as a result of the issue with the state of the home. The state of the home impacts on Ms. Bloomfield and childrens mental well being, and due to the state of disrepair Ms. Bloomfield finds it difficult to clean the home as everything is falling apart and a health hazard. The family have been refused grants from three other charities and really need some fundin to make the standard of the home appropriate for the development and well being of the children. I am writing this letter regarding the above named person. Miss. Bloomfield is a single mother who struggles to support her family financially; the Bloomfield family are unable to refurbish their home, which is in a complete state of disrepair. As the families support worker, I have contacted the housing association to get relevant repairs however, this is still on going. Miss. Bloomfield moved into this property with her five children (three of school age), where her father (Gordon Bloomfield) holds the tenancy to support him when her mother died. The home has not been decorated, refurbished or furnished in twenty years. As a result the sofa in the living room is worn down, dirty and damaged and the family need financial support to refurnish their home to make it a better environment for the children. By better I mean allowing the children to have a safe, stimulating home environment as currently the home is impacting on how they function in and outside the home as well impacting on family relationships.The wallpaper is falling apart and stained with leakage, the family need some paint to re furnish the home and make it a state in which makes the home environement more appropriately stimulating for the children. The family also need carpet to make the standard of the home adequate. The carpet is starting to smell and Susan and children are embarresed to have friends over impacting on their social life. Due to the state of the home environment, the children are embarrassed and ashamed to bring friends indoors. More over, if the family were awarded a grant to re furnish their home the children could have a safe place in the home to interact and engage with friends and prevent any further anti-social behaviour or complaints from neighbours, in turn protecting the family from being at risk of eviction.Ms. Bloomfield has physical mobility issues and is dependant on a scooter, she has COPD and due to this has shortness of breath. As a result Ms. Bloomfield finds it difficult to clean and manage the state of the home, she does get help from her oldest child Emma who is 18, however there is only so much practical support the children can provide in the home as the amount of cleaning and repairs needed are inundated. Therefore, I am asking you to consider the family circumstances and award them a grant to paint and decorate the house to a standard suitable for the children.As the home is in a state of disrepair the children are unable to live comfortably in the home such as; have friends to stay over due to embarrassment, unable to function properly in the home due to its state such as preparing food in a safe way, going to the toilet or bathing in private. Miss. Bloomfield is on benefits and due to this has a limited income and is unable to work due to physical mobility issues. Thus the Bloomfield family would very much benefit from a grant to enable them to make the standard of the home adequate standard for living. The Bloomfield’s need support to make the home to a standard in which is appropriate for the development, and well being of the children.Due to the environment of the family home, the children are unable to have their own space in turn affecting how they do their homework. Enabling the family to get a grant to refurnish their home will create an opportunity for them to start fresh and create a safe, happy family environment for the children. In short this would alleviate stress to the family unit, and decrease the risk of it further affecting other factors such as the children’s school attendance. The Bloomfield children would then have a home they could be proud of which will enable them to respect the house more and give them more incentive to support mother in terms of house cleaning and management. In essence this grant will give the family a lifeline to start afresh and have a home they are proud of and one in which is safe for their health and well being. The house needs some modernising to make it a home that is safe and acceptable for children to thrive in. Currently the home is not enjoyed by Sue and the children and impacts on other parts of their lives, such as anti social behaviour issues in the community and impacting on learning. Ms. Bloomfield is in need of the assistance to enable her to provide a positive environment for the children where they can do their home work and this will signficantly improve their overall quality of life empowering them to have a better future. If this is grant is not awarded the Bloomfields will be unable to improve their standard of living, and this could lead to health deteriotion of Ms. Bloomfield mental health and well being and her father who has recently diagnosed with dementia and al the family only sits in the kicthen due to the stained smelling carpet and exposed flooring all over the home.

Gail has in the past been loaned a powered wheelchair and a self propel chair.  Due to the changes in guidelines for this type of equipment, Gail was unable to have both a self propel and powered chair, and so returned the powered chair to the Wheelchair service within Salford.  As Gail has experience and the freedom of using the powered chair, to now only have the use of the self propel chair has severely restricted her independence in the area that she can now travel.   I have given an approx. cost of £2,000, due to the specialised chair which Gail would need, plus the first years insurance cover.  To ensure that Gail would obtain the appropriate chair and therefore an exact cost, I would envisage a referral to Salford Wheelchair service for their specialist advice.  The service can be contacted on 0161 607 1424.  The chair that would suit Gail would either be a Phoenix or Barrett powered chair.  Again, I apologise for the approx. cost due to the increasing costs of such specialised equipment.0n behalf of Gail, thank you for considering her request to your fund.kind regardsValerie Greenhalgh (Area Warden)    ";"2012-05-08 16:46:30";"2012-05-08 16:46:30";"0"

Zahra suffers from various health problems, her condition is deteriorating and her mobility is poor.  Zahra has lung disease, connective tissue disease, Jo 1 Syndrome, Lupus and Myositis.   She is currently undergoing a course of chemotherapy, which causes additional difficulties and she usually remains in hospital for a few days following her treatment to recover.   Her mobility issues are compounded by the swelling in her joints as a result of the medication she is taking and she is also undergoing a bone density scan due to the amount of steroids she is taking. Prior to becoming ill in 2009 Zahra had recently qualified as a staff nurse, prior to this she was a support worker in the hospital.  She is currently speaking to the NHS HR department as although she has not been receiving sick pay since 2010 her employment has not been formally terminated, but this is imminent.   Zahra does not anticipate receiving a pension as she was unable to join the pension scheme due to financial difficulties. Due to the pain Zahra is experiencing, she would benefit from a rise and recline chair.  Her current sofa and chairs is low and she struggles to get up and down, she uses her walking aids to assist her. We are trying to assist Zahra to apply for funding towards this item.

Ricky and Lisa both have complex medical needs,  and are struggling with their current bathroom facilities but are unable to obtain help from statutory organisations as they do not meet the required criteria. They live in a property owned by Sheffield Homes – Sheffield Homes state that they have met their legal obligations of providing bathing facilities.  The couple cannot apply for a DFG as they do not own their own home, they have treid to apply for a community care grant but this has been declined as it is for alterations to a property, and they are unable to apply for a bank loan as their only income is inclome support and DLA. Ricky and Lisa both have significant mobility issues, Lisa has Crohns Disease and as a result has a stoma, she manages this herself but frequently it leaks and she needs facilities to shower and keep herself clean.   Ricky has a feeding tube and a central line which he needs to keep dry and he struggles to do this in the shower, he also feels a bath would be beneficial for his circulation problems and neuropathy. They currently hace a shower however the flow of water is not strong enough for Lisa to clean her stoma and it takes so long that she becomes very cold.  We are hoping to raise funds to improve the bathroom facilities, a power shower would help Lisa enormouslyThey currently have a shower and a shower chair,  however the water pressure is so weak, that Lisa cannot clean herself properly. She has to spend long period in the shower and this cold and uncomfortable for her. They have obtained two quotes which I have included for the cost of altering their bathroom to meet their needs.   We are assisting them to apply for alternative funding to pay for this work. I have also included a supporting letter from Ricky and Lisa’s Doctor, who agrees that the present facilities are not meeting their needs.  The property currently has a shower and a shower chair, however the shower chair is in need of replacing and the flow of water is inadequate for Lisa to clean herself. Ricky has a feeding tube and neuropathy and a bath would be more appropriate for him, as he should not get his feeding tube wet and soaking his legs in warm water would improve his circulation. We have written to the Act Foundation and Florence Nightingale Aid in Sickness Trust but they are unable to help us.  Independence at Home have offered to contribute but the maximum they can fund is £2000, in view of this we are approaching a number of other charities to see if they could contribute a small amount towards this project.";"2012-05-11 13:01:12";"2012-05-11 13:01:12";"0"

The last 6 years have been the worst of her life and have seen her deal with sexual abuse, drug addiction severe mental health problems and the subsequent loss of her 2 children who are now cared for by Leeann's mother. Leeann turned to drugs as a way of coping after experiencing sexual abuse. She did not know how to cope with all the negative feelings that she had so decided to block them out instead. She also became very low and reclusive and began to dread venturing into the outside world. This took a toll on her relationship with her 2 daughters and eventually Leeann's mum intervened and was awarded custody of them.Two years ago Leeann was awarded a permanent tenancy that was in a different area to Edinburgh than where the abuse and drug addiction took place and decided to take the flat in the hope of the getting a fresh start and putting her life back together.Leeann has since stopped using drugs and has been linked up with a counsellor who specialises in helping those who have suffered sexual abuse. While she still goes through periods of extreme stress and anxiety and remains agoraphobic she is making good progress.The next step on Leeann's path is to make her flat a proper home in which she can be safe, comfortable and relaxed and hopefully at some point in the future be reunited with her children.She currently does not have any floor coverings in her home. Each time she has a seizure she runs a high risk of hurting herself on the hard floorboards but it also hampers her mental health as the flat does not feel safe and homely.We are able to provide her with flooring for her house for £599.

Tania suffers with hypermobility of joints, and depression which at times is severe- the conditions makes her often very tired .  She takes Sertraline for depression, and is on methadone, hoping to detox further when she can. She finds it difficult to mix as she is fearful of people finding out about her difficult past.She has weekly urine tests to check she is drug free (or she knows she would lose custody of her baby at once if she is not drug free).She has suffered from abuse in childhood, and domestic violence, and her baby son is not allowed to see his grandparents.  She signed on 21/5/12 for a new tenancy, with Midland Heart housing association. She was advised by Social services to move or she would be at risk of losing custody of her baby son who is 6 months old and under child protection measures.  She has also been told that her custody of him is at risk unless she gets flooring very quickly for at least one room, as the floors are bare concrete at present.She has been making great efforts to make a new life and home for herself and her baby son despite her disabilities and a grant for or towards carpeting would help towards this aim very much.  A grant would be most useful either for the living room, but if not in time for this both of the bedrooms need carpeting when funds permit.We have helped Tania on 21/5/12 to apply for a Community Care Grant.  However, she is unlikely to get a response to this within 4 weeks, and then may need to appeal, which is why we are making this application. Athough her financial statement shows some spare income she does not have enough money for the carpeting of the flat as required by social services.She has added costs due to mobility restrictions, plus recent extra costs caused by the need to move for removal expenses and equipping a larger dwelling, plus other added costs of buying clothes for a growing baby.She had an older son, now aged 13, who has been in the care of his father in Chichester since age of 3, and Tanya goes down to see him once a month on the train – she has the regular extra costs of the train fare plus food expenses and to entertain him, which she says tend to use up whatever money she has left.We have allocated the following costs to the sections on your financial statement as indicated: £4 a week pet food – added to food and housekeeping,£10 a week to furniture costs – added in at Catalogue section£4.70 a week gifts – added in at Pocket Money sectionPlease note she sends £20 a week to her 13 year old’s father as a maintenance contribution.She currently has direct deductions from Income Support for a Magistrates’ Court fine, Social Fund Loan, Water charges and is setting up a payment plan toward Council rent arrears.She is currently being supported by Social Services, Health Visitor, and Chepstow House (who help and support women at risk of offending and ex-offenders), She has been referred recently to Homestart.";"2012-05-23 16:28:37";"2012-05-23 16:28:37";"0"

She has recently become very distressed after being turned down again for Attendance Allowance (letter dated 30 April 2012). This is because her Arthritis changes daily in severity. Some days she cannot move at all and others she can just about manage to get the bus.Dorothy lives alone in sheltered accommodation but has no family or friends in the area who help her. Dorothy cannot afford to buy an outdoor mobility scooter. A mobility scooter would transform her life and give Mrs Cameron the independence she needs.If you are able to help and you require any more information please feel free to contact me on 01253 405959";"2012-05-30 12:52:02";"2012-05-30 12:52:02";"0"

Due to her illness and mobility problem, she is always weak as a result of medication; she also requires having a better diet, which brings a lot of financial constraint to her.Miss Ester Niyonsaba living with her two daughters at her accommodation has been at the property since June 2006. The washing machine she has been using is out of order. Her financial circumstance wouldn’t allow her to buy a washing machine.

I did approach her with a view to applying for DLA, but she says her doctor says that she keeps going, and that is the most important thing. She is just not sure at present. She lives on her own. Her three children have left home. Her eldest daughter lives quite close, but is on benefits herself. Her younger daughter has moved away, and has a son of her own. Her son, who also has a family, gives her £15.00 per week towards some food shopping. She can no longer afford to come to our Pensioner Club. She did have another job, along with the one she has already, but a couple of months they let her go, as they said they no longer needed her. She is desperately looking for another job. However, I am not convinced this is the answer, as she does cleaning, and it has an enormous impact on her health. I will pursue the DLA application with her, and hopefully she will agree. She has not had a partner for 20 years, and as a result, surviving on very low income, items in her home need replacing. In fact, she does have a settee, but it is totally worn. She does not have a bed or mattress, and sleeps on the settee, which is not at all suitable. She does not have a wardrobe, but her clothes that she has had for years, hang on a rail. She does not have any bedroom furniture at all. I have requested that she obtain a CCG Form to enable me to make an application, but at present I do not hold out much hope, as they are only being granted in extreme cases. I have yet to get the form. Tina survives on a Bank Overdraft of £100.00 and lives extremely frugally. She does not have a Social Life, as she cannot afford it. I am looking at other ways in which our organisation might be able to help, though, as you are aware, we are a charity and normally do not have these sorts of funds.

Sadly, approximately 4 years ago, Margaret's husband died, and at that time, her son-in-law owed them a huge amount of money. Even more sadly, this caused an enormous rift, and Margaret had to leave, taking only the Settee and a Coffee Table with her. Everything else that she owned, her daughter and son-in-law kept.

This unsettled lifestyle caused her mental health to dip and Michelle became increasingly anxious. Michelle was delighted to finally receive her own tenancy in April, and is trying to take responsibility for her life and to build somewhere which she can call home. She is feeling more positive about the future, and is keen to engage with support.We would like to help Michelle equip her tenancy so she can look after herself.

It was caused by an operation to remove her gallbladder and sadly her doctor has told her that there is nothing that can be done to reverse the damage and that Patricia will have to cope with the incontinence for the rest of her life. When Patricia first returned to her home of 5 years after her operation she thought that the incontinence was just a short term side effect so did not mention it to doctors and was too embarrassed to tell family or friends. By the time she approached her doctor for help her bed had been destroyed through soiling and is now extremely unhygienic. She has now been offered the use of plastic sheets via her OT but she is still reluctant to sleep on the soiled bed. Patricia’s incontinence also means she has to do a lot of laundry and while she has a functioning washing machine she does not have proper drying facilities or room in her house to hand many loads of washing.  She feels that having a tumble dryer in her house will enable to cope better with the constant laundry and keep her well supplied with changes of clothes and linens. Patricia is not eligible for a community care grant because of the length of time she has lived in her tenancy and has not available funds to replace her bed or buy a tumble dryer. We are able to supply her with both these items for £285 and I would be very grateful if you could consider her for a one-off grant to cover this cost.";"2012-06-20 11:13:26";"2012-06-20 11:13:26";"0"

She needs to get the bus to the hospital and this is expensive for her. She also spends quite alot of money on sanitary-ware as she bleeds alot, every 2-3 days. She takes mefenamic acid to reduce the pain and bleeding. She has to make 2 or 3 trips in a day when doing a food shop as she can't carry anything too heavy otherwise she bleeds more. She is seeing her GP regarding this problem. If she had extra money she could pay for a taxi to carry her food shopping to her home as it wouldn't be very expensive. Distance not too great. She survives on a very limited income, is unable to save and is not entitled to any public funding. She is in the process of having a fresh asylum claim submitted. She was born and brought up in Eritrea. Her husband was killed during the civil war and her only child is missing. Medina worked as a house-maid in Saudi Arabia where I believe she was very badly treated before coming to the UK. She is under the care of Freedom From Toture. She suffers anxiety and finds it difficult to sleep as she has recurrent nightmares.

Lesley suffers with various health issues the worst of which is Fybromyalgia and her Diabetes.  Lesley has suffered with Fybromyalgia for the last 11 years and explained that the symptoms leaving her feeling lethargic, often gives her headaches and muscle aches down the left side of her body.  Some days Lesley stated that she is unable to get up out of bed although she tries desperately to complete normal tasks.  Lesley does not know when the symptoms will appear and usually has to take one day at a time.  Lesley states that she is rarely without pain.  Lesley was also diagnosed as a diabetic where she has to take insulin injections daily since 2007.  Lesley was also diagnosed with Osteoarthritis in 2010 although has had cartilage surgery 17 years ago, Lesley is waiting for a further operation on her left knee.  Lesley has the usual pumps associated with Asthma and takes them as and when she feels an attack coming on.   Lesley has had a chaotic lifestyle and admitted to me during support sessions that she had been the victim of domestic abuse from her two relationships the recent relationship she fled last year.  I have referred Lesley to the local Cardiff Women's Aid group to receive counselling and support as she is clearly still suffering the effects of domestic abuse.  Lesley would like to apply for a washer dryer machine as she is on a low income and is unable to afford a washing/dryer.  Lesley states that she needs a washer dryer as this would be helpful in managing her health needs particularly relating to Fybromyalgia.  During the last two support visits I have noted that Lesley has worn hand restraints and she explained that when her muscles ache she is unable to use her hands fully.  Lesley needs to ensure that she is constantly warm so that her muscles do not seize.   Lesley is on a limited budget and states that a washer/dryer machine would assist her immensely in her daily living skills.  Lesley has no washer/dryer and has attended the local launderette however because of her limited budget is unable to carry her items due to her condition and afford to use the service.

My GP has advised that undertaking a physical activity could assist in remeding this, whilst also assisting me to strengthen some of my core muscles.  My disabilty have stopped me from engaging in any activity due to being unable to walk long distances.  However, I have tried using a trike from a shop and have discovered that I am able to use this pain free.  I have no family that could assist me with funding a trike and have limited funds due to the cost of living rising significantly over the last year.

It has totally destroyed her knee joint and she has a discharging sinus below the joint requiring regular dressings and is in constant pain. She will require an extended 9 mth course of treatment then possibly a knee replacement. I have referred her to the local dental hospital for assessment. When I told her I would apply to see if I could access a small grant for her she became very tearful. She said she was happy. Her daughter who she lives with has been here with her family for 4 years now. She told me money was a bit tighter since her mother has come to live with them.

She takes Citalopram for 4-5 years and has recently started taking PeroxitineShe  is a recovering alcoholic and has periods of binge drinking which increase when her stress levels go up and can lead to violent outburst which have resulted in anti-social behaviour.She tells us that she has had two spells in re-hab – the first for 7 months, was successful, but she says that she had no support afterwards, and slipped back into old ways.  The second period only lasted 2 wks and was not successful.  These events make it harder to cope with her current situation and add to her depression.She tells us that she has had no carpeting in her house since moving in 12 years ago, due to very limited finances.  She lives in a council 2 bed flat which is in poor condition – there is no damp proof course and it is hard to heat – these factors also increase her stress levels especially during cold weather.We therefore request an amount left to your discretion for flooring costs.She is also in need of a washing machine – to have one would save laundrette costs and having to do washing by hand which is hard with no mangle or drying facilities.We are applying to another charity to ask for funding for this item.She has had help to complete a Community Care Grant form for flooring and a washing machine. This request was turned down on 30th July, and a review of the decision has been sent in this week, but we are not hopeful of a positive outcome.Her only income is ESA at the assessment rate– she has recently had the medical but not yet had any result.  We have completed a financial statement for her – she tells us she struggles to pay the TV Licence and Water regularly.Linsay has been seen at the CAB Outreach at Chepstow House, a Ministry of Justice funded project which is part of Brighter futures.She is being helped by engaging in the project and joining in with life skills sessions, Counselling and other help including support with day to day issues. Also, it is a safe environment to come to and spend time at, with activities such as art classes and access to an information room, which help to ease the symptoms she suffers at home due to the unpleasant living conditions.

Norman has no other family to care for him so Mary has taken on the role as his 24 hour carer. Mary herself is not in good health. She has quite severe COPD and gets breathless very easily. Because of this, and her caring role, she does not get out as much as she would like. A simple task such as walking to the local shops is quite a task for Mary because of her illness. She is also very anxious about leaving Norman on his own so needs to get to and from the shops in a short space of time. A mobility scooter would make this task much easier for Mary. She is also feeling quite socially isolated and is worried that she may soon loose her independence- she is worried about what the affect this will also have on Norman. With a mobility scooter she would have the ability to continue to see her friends and keep socialising in the little free time she has. Thank you for your time.

Sharon has a history of depression and is prescribed Zopiclone and Citalopram. Her depression was exacerbated when her nephew was killed in a motorbike crash 3 years ago. 10 years ago she worked as a carer for the local council and she had to leave work due to her depression. She had a lot of pressure on her because she had just had her child Molly and her partner had left. She therefore had to bring up Molly bu herself. Having been to the property it is clear that it is in good condition. Due to her mental health and financial situation some furniture and white goods were missing. I applied to other trust funds and obtained a fridge-freezer and a bed for Molly. She is now 11 but was still sleeping in her mother's bed because she did not have a bed of her own. A bed has been obtained but cannot put it together because there are no carpets. Sharon says it is uncomfortable not having carpets and is especially cold in winter. She is also embarassed about this when she lets people into the propert. Molly is also starting high school in September and Sharon feels Molly will be embarassed about letter her new friends in. Sharon is making progress and her G.P has referred her to mental health services. She is keen to go back to work in the future. Having carpets would improve her living conditions and make her life more comfortable. ";"2012-08-10 13:50:00";"2012-08-10 13:50:00";"0"

I am the Independent Living Coordinator for Action for Blind People and I am supporting Mrs Jan with Independent Living which includes advice and assistance with grants. Mrs Jan is registered as Severe Sight Impaired/Blind.  Her eye condition is Age –Related Macular Degeneration (wet).  She has some peripheral vision, no central vision, she can see better with some light from behind, has to dark glasses when out in the sun as it makes her eyes dazzle especially so in winter sunshine.She has arthritis in her knees which causes her severe pain and discomfort is unable to walk, stand and stand for even sort periods at a time.  She has extreme difficulty using steps this is both in relation to her physical disability and then also due to her sensory impairment.  She had a very bad fall at the beginning of 2012 where she broke her neck using stairs and also injured other parts of her body.She also has high blood pressure, a weak bladder, she had a stroke in 2003 and also recovering breast cancer.She requires a recliner chair to support her neck, back also her legs and knees.  She is unable to sit in a normal chair and unable to sit for periods comfortably.  She requires an orthopaedic bed to sleep comfortably and to support her neck, back and lower body and to avoid having to get someone to help her move position and to be more comfortable.  She also requires a small fridge freezer which she can keep in her room as she is unable to mobilise herself to her kitchen where she has had extreme difficulty getting to as last time she attempted to go into the kitchen she fell on the stairs to get to the kitchen and broke her neck.  She would also benefit from extra lighting as when she moves from different environments.  She would benefit from the recliner chair and the orthopaedic bed, fridge freezer and lighting to be able to live more independently.Her current income is Pension Credit (guarantee) and the State Pension, and also in receipt of Disability Living allowance.She has difficulties with the following:Moving about indoors: She has difficulty moving about indoors, due to her visual impairment as she trips over objects on the floor. When friends or family come around they inevitably move things without thinking and as she is not aware and trips over items such as shoes handbags, shopping and toys and the carpet that is torn and worn out. Outside the home in other indoor environments she is unaware where everything is situated and this affects her as she cannot see things until she trips over them. She bumps into things such as pillars and shopping trolleys.  She struggles with stairs as her depth perception is not good and she cannot always tell how wide or steep the steps and rises are on a staircase and cannot manage escalators un-aided.  To overcome these difficulties, she relies on the support of a sighted person to assist her by guiding and orientating her indoors. A sighted person is able to inform her if and when objects are moved and highlight obstacles in her path which she is unaware of and describes her surroundings to her.   Getting out of bed in the morning and into bed at night: Physically to get in and out of bed is extremely difficult due to the arthritis in Mrs Jan’s legs and knees as well as her back and also the added injury in her neck where her neck movement is limited very severely.  She has increased difficulty with her vision at night time in the dark and in the morning when curtains are closed and she cannot see objects left on the floor such as shoes slippers and clothing whereby she is at risk of tripping over both getting in and out of bed. When in bed: During the night when pillows or the duvet fall off the bed she cannot see in the dark to retrieve them. When she gets up through the night or early morning she has difficulty finding her slippers and dressing gown as she cannot see.  She is unable to sleep comfortable due to her neck being broken and recovering from it and it has left her with long term neck and back problems.  She is unable to move her neck comfortably.   She needs the help of a sighted person to ensure no objects are left in her way and to help retrieve the bedding when it falls off the bed and find her dressing gown and slippers for her, She needs this help 2/3 times seven nights a week for about 5 minutes each time. Help with toilet needs during the day & night: She has difficulty due to her visual impairment, as she cannot tell if toilets are clean and sanitised before and after use, she relies on the support of a sighted person to ensure this is the case.  She also has physical problems getting to the toilet and therefore uses a commode.  She needs this help 5/6 times a day for about 5 minutes each time seven days a week.   Mealtimes: Mrs Jan has difficulty at meal times as she cannot tell where different food is on her plate and struggles to de-bone fish and chicken. When out she cannot read the menu to select what she would like to eat / drink. She has difficulty making brews and sometimes do not put enough water in the mug or even over fill it.   She is unable to go to her kitchen which is on a lower floor from her living room and she also sleeps in her living room as she is unable to use stairs safely and therefore would require a fridge freezer in the room so she can get to her medication and also food as she need to eat in small amounts at regular intervals due to my diabetes.    She needs help 7 days a week 2/3 times a day for about 15-30 minutes from a sighted person to assist with the above.  Someone keeping an eye on you: She needs the support of a sighted person to ensure her safety with her everyday living, she needs support in her home to ensure her safety especially in the kitchen and making sure that the cooker is turned off properly to help her mop up spillages and breakages as she cannot see to do this herself and risk slipping or walking on broken crockery/glass. Since her fall in January 2012 she is unable to perform tasks in the kitchen.   Falls or Stumble: Mrs Jan can fall or stumble indoors or outdoors due to her visual impairment as she cannot see obstacles in her way, she struggles with uneven surfaces and her depth perception is poor so she struggles with steps and stairs too. She needs help from a sighted person to identify obstacles and guide her where there are uneven surfaces and steps/stairs. She needs this help seven days a week, depending on what she is doing depends on the amount of time and how often each day she needs help.   One of her worst falls was this January 2012 which has left Mrs Jan with a broken neck a C1 and C2 break.  Communicating with other people: Due to her visual impairment, she has lots of difficulty communicating. Mrs Jan cannot read or respond to correspondence nor complete forms. She struggles to identify callers at the door which leaves her vulnerable as she cannot even tell if it’s a neighbour until they have spoken. She cannot read magazines or TV listings. She cannot read information on CDs & DVDs and have difficulty operating stereo equipment as the writing and controls are very small and her visual acuity is extremely poor due to lack of central vision.   She requires extra lighting with communication. Shopping is a nightmare as she cannot see prices or identify different styles of clothes or sizes and struggle with identifying notes/coins and using the hole in the wall to get cash out. When shopping she is unable to find the area in the shop to find the particular merchandise she is after.  She needs the help of a sighted person to support her a lot with communicating with other people every day of the week to help her identify things, describe items, operate equipment, read mail and respond appropriately on her behalf. She needs this help 2/3 times each day from 10 minutes up to 2/3 hours depending on what she is doing or needs to do.  Help I need when out during the day or evening: She cannot answer her door as she cannot identify strangers at the door and this makes her extremely vulnerable. She needs supervision continually throughout the day to prevent substantial danger to herself/others.  She relies totally on her family to support her with her personal care needs and ensure she is safe and protected from danger. She needs this help almost 24/7 from a sighted person.

She was originally sponsored by her father and brother. Her family are part of the Osu caste in Nigeria. The Osu are people are socially isolated in Nigeria. However, Linda’s father was a successful businessman and was able to purchase land and property, so he could afford to send his daughter to London to study. Shortly after Linda arrived his land was confiscated and he and her brother were shot. Linda was unable to take up her studies as she could not earn enough from working part time as a cleaner to pay for her fees. Since she could not attend her university course we are aware that Linda has made great efforts to improve her education and skills through attending various courses.In the year following her arrival to the UK Linda met her partner, who was also Nigerian.  In the early part of 2008 Linda became pregnant and at 4 months she was diagnosed as being HIV. Neither she or her partner felt they could cope with the discovery of the diagnoses as well as starting a family and Linda was persuaded, reluctantly, to terminate the pregnancy.  A year later she became pregnant again.  This time she refused to abort as she now understood that her baby would not automatically be born with HIV. This caused some friction between her and her partner who decided to travel to Nigeria to visit his family. Linda did not hear from her partner for a few months and she became increasingly anxious.  In her seventh month of pregnancy her partner’s brother travelled to London and told her that her partner had been shot dead. The stress of another bereavement effected her health and she began to suffer from very high blood pressure which meant she was unable to deliver naturally and had to have a caesarean section.  Linda and her son Evachris have been supported by The Cara Trust for a number of years. This has included one-to-one support in the community, providing her with complementary therapies and attendance at our support groups. She is a well liked and supported member of the organisation who always makes an effort to try and help other members, particularly those women who are newly diagnosed and feeling vulnerable or those with young children. We really appreciate the efforts she has made with this. Her student visa has now expired, she put in an application to the Home Office for leave to remain on the basis that it would be unsafe for her to return to Nigeria where her family have been persecuted. However, her request for leave to remain has been refused, therefore she currently has no legal immigration status in the UK. Linda does not want to return to Nigeria for fear of persecution, in addition she is extremely worried she will be unable to access antiretroviral drugs which are essential to treat her HIV if she returns to Nigeria.Linda was been housed and supported by NASS in Tottenham. However, since the refusal of the Home Office on her leave to remain application, NASS have refused to carry on housing and supporting her. Forcing Linda and Evachris to rely on the kindness of friends, unfortunately as she is restricted and unable to work she cannot contribute to her friend’s household or even look after herself and Evachris, therefore leading to some tense moments with her friend. Linda really is in a desperate situation and often has to rely on her wits or the kindness of other friends to provide for her son.Linda and Evachris’s needs•	Linda cannot afford to buy Evachris any toys.  £100 would allow her to buy some basic activity and learning toys.•	Linda has no money for clothes for either herself or Evachris. £300 would help her get essential clothes for Evachris and a few items for herself.•	Linda often struggles to feed herself and Evachris. £400 would provide a lot of help for a couple of months and help them both eat nutriciously. •	Evachris’s pushchair is broken and he desperately needs a new one a pushchair would cost £59.99In total Linda needs £859.99 to buy food, toys, a pushchair and clothes for herself and her son.We recognise that funds available to the Margarets Fund are limited so we are also applying to the Fund for Human Need, The Heinz & Carol Kroch Foundation, the Newby Trust Limited and the Children with AIDS Charity. If you are able to make a contribution toward this application this would be much appreciated by Linda.As a charity supporting Linda, we are aware of how hard she is finding to cope at this time, therefore any help you can provide would be gratefully received.   Please make any cheques payble to the Cara Trust. ";"2012-08-15 16:05:26";"2012-08-15 16:05:26";"0"

She wants to access education and has enrolled with her local College to do a Beauty Therapy course to improve her employment prospects.  She was required to pay £55 exam fees which she managed to get together, they then requested a further £204.00 for equipment costs.  Lisa cannot afford this on the limited income that she has and asked if the College to assist her with this and due to her age and lack of dependants they are unable to help and her family and friends cannot help her due to their own financial issues.

This resulted in her leaving the family home at age 15 and slipping into a pattern of homelessness and drug addiction. She spent 2 and a half months in re-habilitation in February 2010, was then in the YMCA for about 3 months, but since then has been homeless until she was  evicted on Monday 30th July from temp 4 weeks of Council accommodation, which followed over 2 years of homelessness.  Rebecca was living as a single person but has been helped to obtain a tenancy with Steve, who is also in receipt of ESA with the work related component. Rebecca has just made a joint claim for benefits; a joint claim for ESA and Council Tax and Housing benefit as a couple. The rent will be £339.00 per calendar month which should be fully covered by Housing Benefit.We will be discussing with Rebecca whether she fulfils the criteria to apply for DLA.She is trying hard to overcome her past problems and make a new life.  She tells us that she and Steve have both been prescribed a drug called is on Subutex, a heroin “blocker”, ie which means that if they were to take heroin there would be no effect. She has no possessions for the home and the accommodation is unfurnished, and she need help to get the items needed.  Her partner to be, Steve, has no assets and has been homeless also.  He suffers with serious health issues including pancreatitis and we have advised her he should get a separate benefit check and claim DLA.We have recently helped Rebecca to complete a Community Care Grant, however if granted it is unlikely to cover all the items needed.Rebecca has been referred to the Chepstow House Project that helps women at risk of offending.  She is not required to attend by the Courts.  She attends to access the support she can access.She and Stephen are also accessing support from CRI (help for those who have had drug issues) , Adsis (now called Aquarius), AdAction, and Mind.An award of  money would be helpful to fund a cooker or fridge.  Also,she tells us that the property has no adequate flooring throughout.  An award of whatever you are able to grant would be a great morale boost to Rebecca at this stressful time.";"2012-08-31 09:33:16";"2012-08-31 09:33:16";"0"

Her life choices are limited because of her minimal income and long term health conditions, however, to have the opportunity to purchase a mobility scooter would enable her to leave her home unaccompanied and become more included in her community. This would not only relieve pressures on her son who accompanies her when she leaves her home but would also raise her self esteem, confidence and increase her sense of identity. Please look favourably on her application. I believe she has a genuine need for financial assistance.";"2012-12-20 11:54:30";"2012-12-20 11:54:30";"0"

Antonella is a 42-year old woman who has a degenerative bone disorder, and is now registered disabled. Antonella also suffers from schizoaffective disorder and receives regular support within the city.Antonella is due to move into the above address on Monday 17th September, following a period of homelessness. Prior to this, Antonella was living with her husband. Antonella’s husband has been domestically violent towards Antonella for many years and as this has worsened as Antonella has become less independent. Due to her physical and mental Antonella felt unable to leave this relationship until March 2012, when she summoned up the courage to flee the relationship. As a result of this Antonella was awarded additional homelessness and medical points by Southampton City Council, which has enabled her to secure a flat at 5 Albert Rose Court, Southampton.Antonella has very limited funds to enable her to furnish her new home and has been advised that she is ineligible to apply for financial assistance by means of a community care grant. Due to Antonella’s circumstance she left her previous address without any of her belongings. I would therefore be extremely grateful if Margaret’s Fund could provide any financial assistance.Many thanks in advance for any assistance you may be able to offer Antonella.   Yours faithfully, Sarah GreenHousing Support Worker";"2012-09-26 11:41:53";"2012-09-26 11:41:53";"0"

Nora earns just over £1000 per month but as her mortgage is £650 she struggles to make ends meet and constantly has to use her over draft facility. Nora’s son cannot be left alone and goes to a Day Centre whilst Nora is at work, he struggles to sleep and Nora is often exhausted.  The local authority are supporting Nora by arranging agency care for Michael at the beginning of the day to allow Nora to leave for work whilst Michael waits for transport, we have also arranged for help for Nora with household tasks, because we recognise the amount of strain she is experiencing. A holiday with her family in the Philippines would give Nora something to look forward to,  the cost of the flights are expected to be £750.00  We are approaching other Charities to try to secure funding for Michael and have also approached the Carers Centre and the Mary Macarthur Holiday Trust  to ask if they would consider contributing towards this for Nora.

Last year she was an in-patient in the Harplands Psychiatric hospital for a number of weeks.She has had family issues since being abused as a child and her abuser still lives in the area, which makes her constantly fearful.  She has difficulties with some relationships as a result which have led to a court appearance.She also suffers with ear problems – has had  3 ops on left ear and infections, also with arthritis/fibromyalgia, pain in lower limbs, and has poor grip in left hand.She has lived in her current council housing for seven years, and there is no carpeting at all in the house.She is very much in need of basic carpeting/ flooring for the living area, 3 bedrooms, stairs and landing, and bathroom.  She was quoted £650 some time ago.She has been turned down for a Community Care Grant and does not want to take out a further Budgeting Loan because of the struggle to fund repayments. She has been living for a long time on basic benefits and has been unable to afford flooring.Re her financial statement: she is paying out £32 a week towards Social Fund loan and Income Support overpayment repayments, £.3.55 each to Council Tax and Rent arrears.£4 a week for pet food has been put under “Entertainment”.An award of any money possible towards flooring would help a lot with making the house more comfortable, especially with winter coming on.It would also give her a big boost of morale after what has been a very difficult time lately with personal and family issues.It would also mean she could have her grandson to visit which would be a positive thing for the whole family.Georgina has been referred recently by the Courts to Chepstow House, an outreach centre that helps vulnerable women and women at risk of offending.She receives ongoing help and support here. If she is awarded any charity grant the money will be spent under the supervision of her Support worker, and a receipt can be supplied if required.We have booked her an appointment to help her to apply for DLA, which she tells us she has been awarded in the past.  We have also arranged an appointment to give her further advice about debt issues; she has arrangements in place for all her Priority debts.";"2012-10-17 15:59:12";"2012-10-17 15:59:12";"0"

They have no gas in the village so coal is the only source of heat.  Since the last application, Diane has received an additional diagnosis of dementia and is struggling with income and heating – currently owing £100 coal and paying off money towards debts gained when their disability benefit was stopped at the end of a claim (this has now been sorted and the benefit re-instated but Diane is still paying of the debts that built at the time).  Diane would like the trustees to see if it is possible to re-consider a 2nd grant application to support with the cost of heating/coal over the winter to help her be able to de-crease their debts without having to cut down on the amount of heating they use (this is the only source of expenditure they could cut back costs on as already been for advice from CAB). Diane is the main carer for her husband and they are guardians to their grandson who lives with them and whom Diane is also main carer for. They also live in a rural area and are having to transporting the grandchild to his college course as well as attend medical appointments as no bus route.   Diane would appreciate if you would consider a 2nd application to support her.

Since 2010 she has suffered two further transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), followed by another stroke in June this year. This second stroke has affected her physically, cognitively and socially. Joanne is 44 years old and is a housewife to two teenage girls. Her husband is very supportive but has gone back to work to help provide for his family. At present Joanne is in a self-propelled wheelchair which only gives Joanne access to the downstairs which is difficult as it is quite cumbersome to manoeuvre. She is also unable to access her garden as there is no ramp for the wheelchair.The stroke has left Joanne with paralysis down the left side affecting both her arm and leg. She currently has a splint fitted to her left leg and she leans significantly to the left. She also has to have her drinks thickened and food pureed as her swallow reflex has been affected. She has carers who go in twice a day to help with daily tasks such as washing, dressing and making food and to ensure that she is safe.Another way is which the stroke has affected Joanne is cognitively. She has early onset dementia as a result of the stroke. This has caused short term memory loss; she often doesn’t remember what day it is and although she is able to follow simple instructions she forgets that she’s done them meaning that she can’t be left alone for any length of time. 	Prior to the stroke Joanne was very active and enjoyed taking on most household tasks such as gardening, painting and decorating and making meals. She also enjoyed showing her dogs at dog shows and going to bingo with her friends. Unfortunately she is unable to do these things now and has to rely on her husband and her daughters for everything and feels as though the children have had to take over and the roles have been reversed.The reason for writing to you and other charities is to get some help towards funding a fully powered wheelchair for Joanne that is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use .This would give her greater flexibility around the home and also more freedom and independence outside to do some of the things she used to enjoy before she had her stroke. It would also help Joanne to enjoy being a mum and wife again.Joanne and her family have so far raised £500 towards the cost of the wheelchair which is approximately £3,800 and are continuously looking for other fundraising opportunities to help contribute further. I would be grateful if you could indicate whether you may be able to help this lady who is going through a very difficult time.";"2012-10-29 11:14:40";"2012-10-29 11:14:40";"0"

She says she was forcefully evicted from her property which until her daughter and son in law moved in with her was fully paid for and in her own name. They “coerced” her into signing the house over to them on a 50-50 deal of variation and a deed of declaration saying that her 50% would be put into a trust for the children. She didn’t fully understand the implications of this and following some family breakdown and reports from both sides of violence she was forcefully evicted from her home. She has shown paperwork which says she was found not guilty of assault. Her daughter was Cambridge educated in law. She feels stitched up by her own daughter and is untrusting but says she has had a psychiatric assessment at Waterford House which showed a clean bill of mental health.

Miss Jarvis suffers from sickle cell anaemia which is a serious blood disorder which affects the red blood cells. The red blood cell in a sickle cell suffer is in a ""sickle"" shape, due to this irregular shape the blood is unable to flow through the blood vessels freely causing clots which obstructs the flow of blood. This is known as sickling.   This can cause severe pain named a ‘crisis’ and other complications can follow if not treated. Miss Jarvis has to regularly take medication and visit the hospital for treatment on a monthly basis.Miss Jarvis experinces very painful crisis  and at times  requries a carer for support, she suffers from servere migranes which last up 3 to 5 days. She also experinces weakness in her legs where she struggles to walk or at times cannot even get out of bed. In March 2010 Miss Jarvis suffered from a heart attack and was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation, she has to take extra medication to help control this condition. Due to Miss Jarvis not being able to work and receiving low-income benefits, she is unable to afford new winter clothing, carpet for her bedroom and heating costs. A grant from your charity would help assist Miss Jarvis as cold weather can trigger a crisis therefore it is essential that Miss Jarvis has an appropriate winter coat, clothing and footwear. A carpet for Miss Jarvis’s bedroom would help generate the heat, as again the cold can trigger off a crisis. As we are approaching the winter months, Miss Jarvis will be using the heating system a lot more than usual as the cold weather can trigger a crisis. However as Miss Jarvis’s benefits are currently under review they have been halved, and therefore she can not afford to keep her home well heated. Any assistance you can provide will be highly beneficial to Miss Jarvis, and help her achieve a better standard of life. I hope all of the above is satisfactory. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached by post and by telephone as detailed in the letterhead, or by email at RJagpal@redcross.org.uk.Thank you for your assistance in this matter.Yours SincerelyRajdeep JagpalSupport Worker";"2012-11-12 14:16:04";"2012-11-12 14:36:40";"0"

Wendy's speech is slurred and this is made more aggressive in stressful situations. Wendy relies soley on her partner for helping in changing and every day tasks, he works 12 hour shifts, so she is uncared for during the day. Wendy has applied for a Disabled Facilities Grants for proposed works by her Occupational Therapist for a stairlift and she has a contribution to pay of £7661.97, the quote received by Handicare for a retractable, power swivaled stairlift is £4,494.00 and Wendy is requiring help to fund this amount in order to be able to access the first floor of her property to be able to use the essential facilities in her bathroom area. Wendy is in a desperate situation and has not been able to shower/bath for the last 10 months, up until her admission to hospital she was working full time as a care worker and following her illness has had to leave full time employemnet and now relies soley on her partners income and her Disability Living Allowance. In December 2012 she required help to pay her gas and electricity over the colder months and funding was avaiable to her via AgeUK Winter warmth campaign. Support has been given to Wendy from her community matron, the occupational therapy team, DIAL (Disability Information Advice Service) and the adult social care team, Wendy is now working with the rehabilitation team to enable her to gain confidence in everyday tasks. Solihull MBC have also funded a door entry system for her so she is able to be more secure in her own home and a ramp will be installed to the fron of her property for easier access, this again is being funded.

Heather has frequent appointments with a psychiatrist and is awaiting intense intervention treatment. Medication has been prescribed for her depression. Heather also suffers from a great deal of lower back pain for which she takes tramadol. Due to Heather’s health conditions she unable to work.In addition to dealing with her own health problems, Heather is also a carer for her son Stuart. Heather has been caring for Stuart for most of his adult life. Stuart suffers from alcohol addiction although he refuses to acknowledge this. He also has issues surrounding substance misuse in regard to the inappropriate use of prescribed medication and he also uses un-prescribed medication of others. In regard to her caring role Heather visits Stuart’s home regularly to cook and do other household chores as he neglects his home environment. Stuart is very demanding of Heather emotionally and financially. Stuart is very persistent in regard to demanding money or support from Heather and will often visit Heather’s property in order to get what he wants. Heather sees Stuart everyday and she feels like she has to be “on duty” 24/7 for him. Heather does not sleep well due to her own health and the emotional impact of caring for Stuart. Heather has no support from other family members in her caring role for Stuart as her other children do not live locally. Heather also provides care for her brother who is in supported living which means she is under a great deal of pressure as she spends the majority of her time caring.Heather requires a new washing machine as the one she has is broken. It is vital that Heather gets this washing machine replaced as she suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. As a consequence of this disorder Heather uses the washing machine up to four times per day. She has been unable to do this since her washing machine broke and it is causing her a great deal of stress. A new washing machine is necessary for Heather to ensure that all of her clothes are kept clean. Heather also often washes Stuart’s clothes as well as her own as he sometimes neglects his personal hygiene. By doing this Heather can ensure that Stuart isn’t wearing dirty clothes. The estimated cost of a washing machine including installation and delivery fees is £200.00. As Heather is currently unemployed due to both ill health and caring for her son, she has limited funds to be able to afford a washing machine on her own.";"2012-11-19 12:55:25";"2012-11-19 12:55:25";"0"

She tells us that he is currently sleeping in her bed and she sleeps downstairs.She does not want to ask for a Social fund loan because of the extra strain this causes with deductions.Lisa suffers with cellulitis, COPD (50% lung function) - resulting shortness of breath, fear of going out in crowds, and takes methadone.Her legs swell and she can find it takes time to get going with walking after she stands up. She had a referral to see the hospital in Feb 2013 about this.  She receives ESA at the assessment rate, and Council Tax and Housing Benefit which is her only income.She is currently appealing the decision turning her down for ESA at Tribunal.She lives with a daughter aged 21 claiming JSA, and her 17 year old son who started in September on an approved training scheme. Finances have been especially tight since benefits for her son stopped when he left school. She has made a claim for Child Benefit as the scheme should enable her to qualify for this, and she is waiting for this to be processed. She has not managed to claim Child Tax Credit although she has phoned them, and we have advised her that she could claim and backdate the claim by 31 days.  We have offered to help her to do this at her next appointment if necessary.We have advised her that she could apply for DLA, and have requested the form and will help her to complete this. She has been struggling to get about for some time and relies on lifts from family.Lisa has been referred recently by the Courts to Chepstow House, an outreach centre that helps vulnerable women and women at risk of offending.She receives ongoing help and support here including Outreach CAB Support.

At that time she planned that she wanted to enjoy the last 6 months of her life before going home to die.Clearly Sarah didn’t go home – she met lots of people here and made many friends, particularly through churches.By 2006 she was living with and helping a friend look after her children; unfortunately this friend stole her passport and threw her out upon learning of her HIV infection. Sarah also started attending Ealing HIV clinic in that year, where she was refused access to anti HIV medications. Eventually she switched to St. Mary’s hospital, which provided her with the necessary medications to keep her healthy. Other health problems that Sarah suffers from include Type 2 Diabetes, Asthma, Elevated Cholesterol and Depression.Sarah didn’t know about how to apply to the Home Office for Leave to Remain and has had no recourse to any public funds since she arrived in 2005. She has been living off the generosity of friends, churches and charities.She currently feels trapped in a relationship and living situation that she doesn’t want to be in, but sees that her only alternative is living on the street. As she is 54 she doesn’t really have the strength or stamina to survive that.This has spurred her on to find a lawyer and start the process of making an application to the Home Office, for which she needs to raise the £560 fees. She’s managed to save £200 from gifts she has received, which has meant cutting back on food and essential items.Sarah feels like she really can’t go back to South Africa as she was gang-raped there in 2001, and she thinks that is when she probably contracted HIV. Furthermore, she now feels like her home is here, in London, where she has made friends and met peers. This, she feels, is her new family and new life.We have also applied to St John Southworth Fund and Fund for Human Need.";"2012-12-15 14:21:08";"2012-12-15 14:21:08";"0"

She is ""sofa surfing"" amongst friends she has made through being a service user here at George House Trust. She has submitted a fresh asylum claim.  She was diagnosed HIV positive in 2007.

She is in dire need of warm winter clothing, a sleeping bag and a holdall.  She is ineligible for assistance from any of the other charities we approach for funds such as the Terrence Higgins Trust as she has already reached their ""lifetime"" limit of support.

Until recently they have shared the double bed in the home but since Bibi’s illness Nazir is either sleeping on the sofa downstairs, or when she feels her mother is unwell and may need her in the night she sleeps on a mattress in her mother’s bedroom. Nazir is the sole carer for her mother and is unable to leave her, unless her aunt visits to relieve her, Nazir’s caring responsibilities means she is isolated and tired and a new bed would be a great benefit to her. The family have a very limited income and are unable to purchase these items themselves,  we have arranged for a benefit check for them as they are really struggling to keep up with their household commitments despite spending money only on essential items.

Diane has spent her life raising a family, while her husband worked hard in the cutlery industry in order to support them. Over the last few years Diane has suffered a decline in her health. Diane has arthritis throughout her body which leaves her in constant pain and makes it difficult for her to complete everyday tasks. In 2008, Diane had a stroke which has left her with reduced mobility and dependent on her husband and family to support her with personal care tasks, as well as supporting with shopping, cooking and cleaning.Diane has also been diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) which leaves Diane with a wheezy chest, a mucus cough and recurring respiratory infections. Diane becomes easily breathless and finds it difficult to walk more than a few steps without stopping to rest and catch her breathe. This combined with Diane’s asthma and recurring chest infections means she spends majority of her time confined to her home, apart from occasionally visiting her family who live across the road. Diane’s husband Terry has given up work in order to care for Diane full-time which means their only income is Diane’s Income Support and DLA and Terry’s Carer’s Allowance. Diane and Terry struggle to find enough money to make it through each week. It is essential for Diane to live in a warm environment in order to maintain her health and avoid chest infections or other illnesses which could be difficult for her to recover from. Diane’s home is fitted with pre-payment meters, which Diane and Terry find easy to manage as they can control how much they are spending and don’t have to live in fear of huge bills in the post. However, the meters are not necessarily cost effective and in the winter months Diane and Terry can spend up to £70 a week keeping their meters topped up and their home warm. When I initially visited Diane in December 2012 she explained how she and Terry are living in a situation where by they have to choose between putting money on their meters for heating or eating a meal. Diane and Terry survive on one hot meal a day, sometimes every other day depending on how low the temperature dips. Diane is surrounded by her family with all four of her children living on the same street who provide her with around the clock support. Unfortunately, Diane’s family are not financially able to support their Mum although they do support her with household tasks, going shopping for them and providing meals when they can. I work with many individuals who face the same problems as Diane and I have previously supported people to apply for their Winter Fuel Payment, discounts from their energy supplier such as Warm Home Discounts as well as charitable grants such as Surviving Winter Grants from South Yorkshire Community Foundation in order to ease the burden. However, Diane is not entitled to any of this support as she is only 55.  Diane would be grateful for a one-off donation of £120 from Margaret’s Fund to support Diane with keeping her gas and electricity meters topped up over the next few months.

Mrs. Thompson suffers from sickle cell anaemia which is a serious blood disorder which affects the red blood cells. The red blood cell in a sickle cell suffer is in a ""sickle"" shape, due to this irregular shape the blood is unable to flow through the blood vessels freely causing clots which obstructs the flow of blood. This is known as sickling.   This can cause severe pain named a ‘crisis’ and other complications can follow if not treated. Mrs. Thompson has to regularly take medication and visit the hospital for treatment on a monthly basis. Mrs. Thompson also suffers with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy in both feet, has a hearing impairment and is also partially sighted. Mrs. Thompson is currently working part-time however due to her declining health she will be made sickness retirement on the 28/02/2013. The stress of this is causing Mrs. Thompson further ill health.  Mrs. Thompson’s health affects her in various ways such as she has to rely on her husband’s support when in crisis. When Mrs. Thompson is ill she is not able to carry out daily activities such as cooking due to her declining sight.As Mrs. Thompson suffers with peripheral neuropathy more often than normal she has been having fall’s which can happen at anytime on any surface.Due to Mrs. Thompson having diabetes she is dependent on insulin which needs to be stored in a fridge. However Mrs. Thompson’s current fridge/freezer does not work properly. The freezer compartment can not be used at all as it does not work. Mrs. Thompson relies on the fridge for storing her insulin medication and requires the freezer for ready made meals on the days she is not able to cook due to ill health. Any support that your charity can provide will help Mrs. Thompson to purchase a new fridge/freezer which will help her to remain independent within the home. I hope all of the above is satisfactory. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached by post and by telephone as detailed in the letterhead, or by email at RJagpal@redcross.org.uk.Thank you for your assistance in this matter.Yours SincerelyRajdeep JagpalSupport Worker";"2013-01-17 11:54:46";"2013-01-17 11:54:46";"0"

Miss Hermitt suffers from sickle cell anaemia which is a serious blood disorder which affects the red blood cells. The red blood cell in a sickle cell suffer is in a ""sickle"" shape, due to this irregular shape the blood is unable to flow through the blood vessels freely causing clots which obstructs the flow of blood. This is known as sickling.   This can cause severe pain named a ‘crisis’ and other complications can follow if not treated. Miss Hermitt has to regularly take medication and visit the hospital for treatment on a monthly basis. Ms Hermitt experiences sickle pain on a daily basis in her spine, shoulders, knees and chest. Ms Hermitt relies on her family to support and care for her to complete daily living tasks such as washing, dressing, cooking and other general household duties. During the morning, it takes Ms Hermitt a while to get out of bed as she is in crippling pain. Ms Hermitt has to take medication on a regular basis and when in crisis, she needs hospital treatment. Ms Hermitt also visits the hospital every month for blood transfusions; the ambulance service collects her for these appointments. Ms Hermitt uses a walking stick to help alleviate the pressure in her knees, as the pain in these areas, which make it difficult for her to walk. Ms Hermitt also has problems with her chest and heart, which causes breathlessness; she has an oxygen machine in her home, which helps when she is struggling to breathe. Ms Hermitt also has a stair lift in her home, as she cannot manage any stairs without support. Due to Miss Hermitt not being able to work and receiving low-income benefits, she is unable to afford new winter clothing and heating costs. A grant from your charity would help assist Miss Hermitt as cold weather can trigger a crisis as being cold is one main factor, which triggers a sickle cell crisis. People with Sickle Cell Anaemia tend to feel the cold more than other people. This is because they are chronically anaemic and have difficulties maintaining their body heat, therefore it is essential that Miss Hermitt has adequate amount of heating in her home and has appropriate winter coat, clothing and footwear. Any assistance you can provide will be highly beneficial to Miss Hermitt, and help her achieve a better standard of life. I hope all of the above is satisfactory. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.Yours SincerelyRajdeep JagpalSupport Worker";"2013-01-31 14:37:11";"2013-01-31 14:37:11";"0"

The oldest Son and younger daughter also has Aspergers. Kay uses a wheelchair outside of the house, which she is unable to manouever herself because of her disability (Kay can dislocate her fingers just from using a knife and fork). When the family go shopping (which is the only time Kay manages to get out of the house), Matthew has to manage to push Kays wheelchair, look after the 2 small children, use a trolley big enough for shopping for a family of 6 people as well as carry shopping etc. Kay has no independance and feels that a mobility scooter would allow her to be more independent whilst out with the family, reducing the stress that going out causes and allowing her to go out more often, rather than just to shop. It also means she doesn't have to constantly explain which isle, what part of the isle, which way to turn all the time as this causes stress for both herself and Matthew. It would also free up Matthew to push a family sized shopping trolley and to be better equipped to deal with the 2 younger children whilst out, crossing roads and with general supervision. Social services are going to make home improvements to Kays kitchen so that she can get in there and help where possible and feel like she is doing something, they are also going to build a wheelchair friendly path to and from her front door. Kay can use crutches in the house for very short amounts of time, her house is not large enough for the wheelchair, this does however mean that she is very dependent on her husband and children. Kay suffers from Depression because she feels so dependent all the time. A mobility scooter would make a tremendous difference to the whole family, but Kay especially will feel so much better for the independence and freedom it will allow her.

Miss Jenkins has been a resident at the Leonard Cheshire Home of Gloucestershire for approximately five years.  Miss Jenkins has Cerebral Palsy, is Quadriplegic and has limited communication skills.  Miss Jenkins requires the support of one carer to help her to facilitate communication with other people and develop her understanding.  At times she uses a small bank of words to communicate with other people and express her wishes.  She needs the support of one carer to support symbol usage and identify necessary vocabulary for all practical activities including social, cultural, financial and spiritual practices. Miss Jenkins is non weight bearing and uses an electrical wheelchair to get from one location to another.  She requires the support of two care staff for personal care and all transfers using a power assisted hoist.  At other times Miss Jenkins needs assistance of one carer for all activities of daily living including meal preparation, laundry and shopping tasks.Miss Jenkins also needs the assistance of a carer to accompany her on her proposed holiday to assist with communication, personal care, meal preparation and transferring form one location to another.  Miss Jenkins doesn’t have the financial resources to pay for her proposed holiday and is seeking financial assistance in order to meet the cost of the holiday.  I would support her application for financial assistance towards the cost of her holiday as it would have many benefits for her including increasing her social contact with other people, build her self confidence and enable her to become more independent. I would support her application for financial assistance towards the cost of her holiday to Lourdes. ";"2013-02-11 17:11:04";"2013-02-11 17:11:04";"0"

Miss Tamba and her daughters Fatima aged 6 and Oumie aged 9months suffer from sickle cell anaemia which is a serious blood disorder which affects the red blood cells. The red blood cell in a sickle cell suffer is in a ""sickle"" shape, due to this irregular shape the blood is unable to flow through the blood vessels freely causing clots which obstructs the flow of blood. This is known as sickling.   This can cause severe pain named a ‘crisis’ and other complications can follow if not treated. Miss Tamba and her daughters have to regularly take medication and visit the hospital for treatment.Due to Miss Tamba receiving a low income, she is unable to afford new winter clothing and also the additional heating she requires to prevent herself and her daughters from having a crisis. A grant from your charity would help assist Miss Tamba as cold weather can trigger a crisis therefore it is essential that Miss Tamba has an appropriate winter coat, clothing and footwear. As we are approaching the winter months, Miss Tamba will be using the heating system a lot more than usual as the cold weather can trigger a crisis. However as Miss Tamba is on a low income she can not afford to keep her home well heated. Any assistance you can provide will be highly beneficial to Miss Tamba, and help her achieve a better standard of life. I hope all of the above is satisfactory. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.Thank you for your assistance in this matter.Yours SincerelyRajdeep JagpalSupport Worker";"2013-02-12 15:39:35";"2013-02-12 15:39:35";"0"

This centre has recently closed and she now gets support for her mental health issue at her local health centre instead, about once a month. She is now trying to make the effort to go out more often to access help from outside agencies.Michelle has two children aged 6 and 7 who are cared for by grandparents in Crewe. She says that they come to visit most weekends, which places an extra demand on her finances. Because she has been living long term on benefits she is now in a position where a number of household items need replacing including : bed and mattress, wardrobe and chest of drawers, bed covers and duvet, cooker - electric, microwave, fridge/freezer (creams for excema should be kept in fridge), plus she needs clothing items - jeans, tops, underwear, footwear.We have helped Michelle to apply for a CCG but even if granted it is unlikely to cover all items needed.We ask in this application for funding for a fridge/freezer – hers is very old and no longer working efficiently. Michelle has referred herself to Chepstow House which is an outreach centre in Hanley that supports women who are vulnerable, some of whom ex offenders or at risk of offending to encourage them to re-engage in the community.She has gained help from support workers, accessed CAB outreach, and gets encouragement to take part in group activities such as life-skills and budgeting, and artwork.

Recent social work involvement found her living in squalor with over a year's worth of laundry.  These household items would greatly aid her and help her well-being. Any help that you are able to give would be much appreciated. ";"2013-02-27 10:19:49";"2013-02-28 10:29:40";"0"

Miss Constable  suffers from sickle cell anaemia which is a serious blood disorder which affects the red blood cells. The red blood cell in a sickle cell suffer is in a ""sickle"" shape, due to this irregular shape the blood is unable to flow through the blood vessels freely causing clots which obstructs the flow of blood. This is known as sickling.   This can cause severe pain named a ‘crisis’ and other complications can follow if not treated. Miss Constable  has to regularly take medication and visit the hospital for treatment on a monthly basis. Miss Constable is in the process of applying for benefits and is seeking full time employment. Miss Constable lives with her mother whom also a suffer from Sickle Cell Anaemia; both mother and daughter support each other when experiencing ill health when in crisis. They have currently moved into a new unfurnished home. Miss Constable needs support with setting up her bedroom, with the essential items such as a wardrobe and chest of draws. Miss Constable also need support with purchasing good quality winter coat and boots as the cold weather can trigger a crisis, from which she can be admitted into hospital for. Miss Constable is very tall; she can only shop from certain specialist shops. People with Sickle Cell Anaemia tend to feel the cold more than other people. This is because they are chronically anaemic and have difficulties maintaining their body heat; therefore it is essential that Miss Constable has appropriate winter coat, clothing and footwear. Any assistance you can provide will be highly beneficial to Miss Constable, to help her achieve a better standard of life. I hope all of the above is satisfactory. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I am writing with reference to her application for a grant from your organization as Ms Maughan is also living with long term heart condition.I respectfully request that you consider awarding Ms Maughan a grant. Ms Maughan and her two children are settling into the community after an unsettled way of life.  Ms Maughan was originally from the travelling community but she had been trying to settle down with her two young children. Martina is herself illiterate but would like her children to go school. She has no savings and is currently struggling to support the family financially and to ensure a safe and secure environment for her and her children. Failing to fulfil and manage her tenancy would lead to a breakdown and going back to unsettled way of life. Moreover this could impact on Ms Maughan health condition: she in fact needs a safe and secure environment for best results on her treatment. Ms Maughan has been living in a privately rented accommodation and is on a waiting list for council property. Unfortunately, the property is in a poor state of repair with broken appliances and as she is only relying on benefits, she is struggling to make the place habitable and acquire the basic items that she needs to maintain a healthy diet necessary for her long term heart condition and to provide for her children such as cooker, a washing machine and fridge.   I therefore would like to kindly request that you consider awarding Ms Maughan a grant of £250 to help her raising the money to afford the essential items above.I have enclosed a copy of Ms Maughan’s Consent Form which authorises the British Red Cross to make enquiries on her behalf.

Rachel and her son Callum are not entitled to a free travel passes.Rachel and Callum have finally settled in Coventry after a period of uncertainty, Rachel also struggles with poor health, Rachel has depression and Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome, and I have recently submitted a DLA application.I am currently supporting Rachel to manage her outstanding debts; she has an outstanding debt with Hounslow Council (Council Tax), a loan for £1000.00 with Mutual and a credit card debt for £700.00.I am hoping to support Rachel with some equipment at home which will make things easier for her, Rachel has expressed interest in a mobility aid to help her with reading, Rachel does not own a television and relies on reading books in the evening when Callum has gone to bed.  I would also like to help with some equipment to help in the kitchen – a chopping board and a tool to help with opening bottles, cans etc.Please do not hesitate to contact if you need any further information.";"2013-03-14 12:16:55";"2013-03-14 12:16:55";"0"

She has received a letter acknowledging her claim and requiring her to stay in the country whilst it is considered.  She has not been given recourse to public funds so cannot claim any benefits and is not eligible to work.  This means she is in the position of being completely reliant on friends and her Church for support.  This generally comes in the form of grocery shopping and is occasionally supplemented by small monetary donations amounting to approximately £5 per week. Any money she is given is spent on supplementing their food shopping. She still finds it difficult to have an adequate amount to eat which has the potential to affect the efficacy of her HIV medication.  She is living with a friend in a 2 bedroom flat.  The friend has 3 children of her own.  Deborah and her 7 year old son share 1 room with 2 of the friends children.  On the rare occasion Deborah has any spare money it is given to the friend towards utility bills.  Neither Deborah nor her son have clothing suitable for the current cold weather.  Her son is also experiencing bullying at school due to having outgrown his uniform.  Deborah is extremely stressed by the position she has been put in by trying to follow the directions of the Home Office.  Her stress is increased by the bullying her son is experiencing.  She is suffering from depression leading to insomnia both of which are affecting her ability to cope day to day.  Having a grant towards clothing for them would help reduce this stress and boost her self esteem by enabling her to feel she was able to 'treat' her son to clothes that fit.

Two operations failed to remove the bullet and this was finally removed in 2007 at which time she was diagnosed as HIV positive. Jane is now on medication for her HIV but a side effect of the medication is that she suffers with severe neuropathy (neural pain) in her legs, especially in that which suffered the bullet injury.  The pain level is such that she cannot stand for long periods and this has caused her to reduce the hours she can work as a cleaner.  She is therefore suffering a lot of financial hardship at present and is in need of a new cooker as hers has ""died"" and it is uneconomical to have it repaired.

I have supported her for several years as she is a carer for her daughter. Margaret also has considerable health problems herself, which are listed above. I have completed the financial information section for the whole family (Margaret, husband and daughter) not just for Margaret. There are often times where Margaret cannot drive so has to use taxis instead. This is why there is an amount of £15 under the travel fares section as well as the car running costs. Margaret home schools her daughter because the council were unable to find a suitable special needs placement for her. Margaret's daughter has autism and she struggles to find activities that are suitable for leisure and learning. They usually buy annual membership to Chester Zoo and the National Trust. This is covered under the school trips section. Margaret would really benefit from purchasing a mobility scooter but the family have no savings and there is no way they could afford it without the help of a grant. She would like to purchase a lightweight scooter that could go into the boot of a car, so that they can take it with them on family trips as her husband will be able to lift it into the boot. Currently she has to forego family outings or she has to sit in the car while her husband and daughter go off to do something. She also cannot get down to the local shops using crutches and as she cannot always drive, and her husband works night shifts, it can be difficult to rely on getting food shopping or other essential items in. I fully support Margaret's application.";"2013-04-08 12:29:01";"2013-04-08 12:29:01";NULL

She originally came to this country on a work visa and had a job as a payroll consultant. In August 2012 Frances submitted an application to remain under Article 8 and while she is still waiting for this application to be considered she has no recourse to public funds. This also means, while her status is being determined, she is unable to work. Frances is therefore forced to rely on support from friends and her local church to meet the day to day expenses for herself and her daughter. Food chain supplies the family with regular meals but this support is likely to come to a conclusion in a month or two.Being HIV positive Frances has frequent hospital appointments. The lack of an income impacts her in particular ways which affect her health. She struggles to find money for bus fare and missing appointments can have a detrimental effect on her ability to manage her condition with long term implications. For Frances, knowing she has the ability to pay for regular trips to the hospital will ease her daily concerns about reaching important medical appointments.The stress of money worries on Frances emotional wellbeing also has a knock on effect on Emmanuella. Not knowing how she will get to nursery in the morning and not having the correct clothing to wear all make her more vunerable to bullying and feelings of isolation and insecurity. The nursery requires Emmanuella to wear a uniform but neither they nor the council have provision for a uniform grant for children her age.Having enough money to provide the correct uniform and shoes for Emmanuella will go some way to relieving the daily stress Frances is under.

Her travel expenditure is quite large as she used to have a taxi card but that was taken off her due a change in council policy; she still relies heavily on taxis however to go shopping, visit friends and take her elderly ill cat to the vets as she struggles to use public transport. Due to her health she is quite a large lady and is sleeping on an old bed base and thin worn mattress; she would love to be able to get a firm sturdy comfortable new bed more suitable to her needs. In her weekly household expenditure we have included her costs for the launderette, costs for the special diet she has to provide her cat and she also has to try to eat very healthily herself due to her diabetes. She has had problems in the past with hoarding due to her depression; she has a support worker provided by her housing association to try to help her with this. Her HA have also just refurbished and cleaned her flat for her as it had got into a v bad state-they housed her in temporary accommodation whilst they did this work. She is now determined not to get back into her old habits now the flat is all fresh and clean-she also feels able to have visitors round now-something she has not done for many years as she felt too embarrassed to have people round. The flat having been sorted out for her is another reason she would like to be able to get a new bed now that the flat feels homely, unlike previoulsy. It would be greatly appreciated if the Margarets Fund would be able to assist Ms Bolger towards the cost of a new bed    ";"2013-04-16 09:48:01";"2013-04-16 09:48:01";NULL

Her muscles often don't work and she requires assistance with so many personal daily tasks eg  to get on and off chairs and toilet , bed ect. She is aware that her condition will not improve and at the moment finding any stability is eluding the experts.The items requested are to enable Angela to be as independent as possible.Financial Situation:Angela has been unable to attend work for two years now and it is anticipated that Dorothy Perkins will terminate her pay over the coming months. This will reduce their  income by £135 per week. Jim, her husband, was made redundant around five years ago after working in the same place for 22 years. He however found work in B and Q. Unfortunately Angela became so unwell that she was unable to stay on her home ( having also had a number of falls) and Jim had to give up paid work.Savings:Angela and Jim are aware that they have savings . A number of things are required at the moment to maintain the house and keep it accessible for Angela. As a couple they are conscious that Angela, although a young woman who has worked since aged 17, is unlikely to be able to rejoin the workforce and Jim is needed at home. These saving may have to last the couple for a very long time ( and will have to be spent on the above items)and therefore would appreciate any help towards the above expenses.Personal Note:I have been an advice worker for 30 years working currently here at the Notre Dame Centre and with Stirling University Support Centre.

However they are in real need of essential basic household items such as white goods, furniture, carpets, towels bedding cooking utnesils, any help you can offer will be appreciated.

Her son suffers with asthma and he is currently waiting for counselling.  He is currently on the list for counselling. His father died of a heroin overdose when he was two.Lisa tells us that she has had very little help to buy furnishings/carpeting for the upstairs area of the house after a fire 3 years ago. The fire was started by her son who was then aged 5.She tells us that she was awarded £86 from a Community care grant, which went on replacing clothes. This has caused her financial pressure leaving insufficient income for priority payments.Lisa tells us that she is recently changed her JSA claim and is now  claiming ESA as a single person. She will have approx. £17 a week in direct deductions from this once the deductions have been re-instated, towards a Magistrates Court fine, Council tax arrears (previous to the current year), rent arrears in current housing, and the social fund.She also receives Child Benefit and Child tax credit for her son aged 8.She lives in a two bedroomed Housing association property in receipt of Housing Benefit.She is required to pay £4.11 per week from April 2013 towards Council tax. She says that she still has a back-boiler system and this takes up about £40 a week for fuel costs which is a further drain on her income.We have discussed with her whether there are grounds for her to apply for DLA and we have ordered a form for her today. We have advised her to consider whether she could apply for her son also.Lisa is seeing her GP on Friday to ask whether she should get a fit/sick note as she is considering whether to apply for ESA.We have just applied for help from the recently started Stoke Council Social Fund but they have told us they do not cover flooring costs.Lisa has been seen at  CAB Outreach at Chepstow House, a Ministry of Justice and Brighter Futures funded project to help women at risk of offending and ex-offenders to re-engage with society and offer counselling, one to one support and group support.

Doreen has found a frame that she feels would be suitable at a price of £69.99 from a retailed called Coopers of Stortford.

Her home has a coal fire with a back boiler which is connected to the radiators and provides all heating and hot water for the property.The coal fire has been condemned as the glass on the front is cracked however as this is Iris’s only form of heating she continues to use it when she can, as Iris’s mobility is so poor that she is unable to light the coal fire and has to rely on friends and relatives to light it for her.  When it goes out and there is no one calling she has no heating and no hot water.   At the time I visited it was unlit, this frequently happens and she has to boil all her hot water when it is not lit.  A friend has given her an electric heater, but it is expensive to use.  We are approaching Friends of the Elderly and Independence at Home to try to secure sufficient funding to replace the boiler, however we would like to ask Margarets Fund to provide Iris with a small grant to purchase electric heaters for her home and some additional funds towards her electricity bills so she can use the heaters without worrying too much about the cost of it whilst we try to get funding for a new boiler which we expect to be a lengthy process.

She says that she has not invited anyone in during the last 2 weeks.The alcohol abuse has led to nerve damage in her feet which makes her unsteady and prone to falling.She is in need of a washer:She is reliant on help from her sister who she gives money to for washing costs. She has high washing costs with some incontinence when under the influence of alcohol.She is in need of an electric cooker: She has not had a cooker since moving into her current unfurnished tenancy, and has been reliant on a microwave. She has been having more take away meals which add to her costs and are not a healthy option especially in the longer term.The Council Social fund have been approached but are unable to help.Debts and priority bills: - We have helped her today to set up payment plans for TV License and Severn Trent water as she had not thought to do this.- We have encouraged her to book in to see us again as it appears that she could have other debt issues – not yet disclosed.Houskeeping section: high costs for this section due to spending on alcohol, cigarettes, takeaway meals - £10 per week, laundry - £20 per week to sister at present.Her brother in law helps her do odd jobs and she gives him £10 a week.

She is a refugee from Zimbabwe and until she was granted refugee status late in 2012, she was living in shared accommodation with 19 others whilst on NASS support.  She found it very difficult to adhere to her HIV medication regime whilst living in that situation as her medication required refrigeration and there was only a shared refrigerator in the house. This, together with the appalling poor hygiene in the house, led to her becoming frequently ill with opportunistic infections as her immune system was compromised due to her CD4 count having dropped. She eventually became resistant to her medication (this happens if the prescribed regime is not strictly adhered to) with serious consequences.    She found the shared accommodation so unhygienic that she left and “sofa surfed” for a while with friends  and eventually spent several nights sleeping out on the streets.   She was found by the police one night in a collapsed state (due her worsened HIV condition) and as a result of their helpful intervention was placed in First Street Homeless Centre.   Earlier this year she was allocated unfurnished accommodation and has slowly begun to make this into a home.   With the help of grants we secured for her from Community Care, Terrence Higgins Trust, Independence at Home and our own GHT welfare fund, Nothando has been able to acquire a cooker, fridge and some other essentials.  When she first moved in, she obtained a very cheap and poor quality bed with an old and worn mattress.    She is now on a different HIV medication regime, to which she is responding.  However, she suffers with typical side effects of night sweats, nausea and fatigue.    Her cancer causes her pain and anxiety and this adds to her fatigue and tiredness. Thus there is a very real medical need for her to be able to sleep comfortably and restfully and this is why a grant for a new bed is being requested.The signs are that her cancer is treatable and her HIV health is improving and Nothando has begun to look for agency work but finding work may prove difficult. She is still in need of help and support and helping her establish her accommodation as a proper “home” in which she can rest and feel comfortable will contribute towards her wellbeing and I very much hope you will be able to support this application.";"2013-06-05 13:44:30";"2013-06-05 13:44:30";NULL

Florence is in receipt of Incapacity benefit of £86.87 and an industrial injury payment of £64.64 per week.  Although this maybe stopping soon.  Florence often visits the Citizens Advice bureau for help with her finances because she struggles with memory and organising skills since the accident.  She has debts with all her utilities and a loan of approximately £3000.  Her priority is to pay her mortgage as she does not want to lose her home.The CAB have budgeted Florence’s money for her, but there is often very little left for food. Florence’s fridge is no longer fit for purpose as the seal is missing and handle has broken off.  Florence would also benefit from a tumbler dryer as she has increased laundry due to her incontinence and finds it hard to get it dry in the winter.  Florence sufferes from SAD, and in the past has used a light lamp, she found this very beneficial but it has broken and she would like to replace it before the winter the cost of this item is £150.00Florence has no spare funds to purchase these essential items, please would you consider awarding Florence a grant towards a new light lamp, a fridge and a dryer.

However, because she is taking significant doses of controlled medication M&S could not maintain her contract. This has caused great sadness and increased financial instability. Alison has always taken great pride in her work and supporting her local and wider community. For the last few months Alison's family have helped with additional children's costs of Cubs and Beaver subs. Alison has been offered breast reconstruction surgery on the condition that she loses 4 stone. This however is could be quite difficult due to Lymphodema -pain and swelling in her arms and hands. However, if the surgery were to go ahead this would help to reduce this swelling. Alison would like to buy swimming prostheses, specialist swimming costume & bras.  In addition, Alison would like to buy some new clothes for herself. This would enable her to go swimming with her children and therefore enjoy a family activity that she has not been able to do for almost 5 years. She can also swim independently, when the children are at school-enjoy a leisure activity and form of exercise that she has not been able to enjoy for almost 5 years. The medical prostheses she has is very heavy and contributes to the back, neck pain and swelling she experiences at present. The opportunity to buy some new clothes would help promote a more positive body image and increase her confidence and self esteem. Alison is a very independent lady who is very good at taking care of/supporting others. She finds it incredibly difficult to accept support for herself and her family.

Juliet now has a new application in the Home Office but due to her immigration status she is unable to work in the UK.  Juliet receives charity from friends and is currently getting support from Food Chain which supplies weekly groceries for the family. She finds receiving money from her friends very embarrassing and this has affected her self esteem. The stress of continually having to ask for money just to provide essential items for her family is affecting her sleep and her health.  Juliet is no longer with the children's father and he does not provide them with any financial support. She has no other family in the UK who could provide support with child care or finances. A fridge freezer is essential for Juliet to keep her medication in. It would also benefit the family as a whole giving them more access to fresh fruit and vegetables which would keep longer in the fridge. Being able to have a healthy and balanced diet will improve Juliet’s general well-being and is essential for the growth and development of her children.If this grant is successful it will help ease the stress Juliet is under and therefore put her in a better position to respond to the needs of her children.";"2013-06-17 12:19:25";"2013-06-17 12:19:26";NULL

To ask for funding towards floor coverings and essential household items. Joanne and her son have struggled for a number of years to maintain a safe and healthy home.  Joanne has been evicted twice from her home in the past because of rent arrears and is facing eviction at the moment. Joanne works part time for Sheffield Council as a support worker,  Childrens services have recently become involved with the family because of the poor living conditions they were found to be living in. Joanne has now undergone an assessment and has been found to have a previously un diagnosed learning disability.  As a result we are now arranging for support and care to be provided to Joanne to help her maintain her home.  We are working with Shelter and a debt councillor to resolve her financial difficulties and ensure she is not evicted.Joanne’s home is in a poor state, because they were evicted from there last home they have few possessions.  Childrens services have applied to RG Glasspool and Joannes son has been awarded a grant for  a bed and a wardrobe.  Joanne does not have a bed, and is sleeping on a mattress on the floor.  The cooker they have is not working correctly and only one gas ring is useable.  Joanne wants to try to provide healthy meals for her son but is struggling and they often eat take aways. The family home has no floor coverings, and whilst they have a fridge it freezes up at the bottom and Joanne says milk often goes off in it. Joanne has incurred a lot of debt and although she is working she is unable to manage her finances and in the past has made poor decisions regarding her money.  Because she is working she is not eligible for a social fund loan or free school meals which would e a great benefit to the family. Joanne has rent arrears, she owes the approximately £1500 to N Power for gas and electricity charges, she also has a pay day loan, water arrears, and rent arrears I am approaching the Percy Bilton Trust and The League of Helping Hand to ask for help towards the essential household items they require.  These prioritises are a bed a cooker and a fridge. I am approaching Margarets Fund for help with Essential Household items and floor coverings  and I have also made an application the the Family Holiday Association as Joannes son has not had a holiday since he was four";"2013-06-17 13:21:31";"2013-06-17 13:21:31";NULL

She has been living in this property since 13/8/12. Prior to this she lived with her parents, who currently live very close to her flat to ensure Kayleigh has a support network close by. Three years ago Kayleigh developed epilepsy following a physical attack by an ex-partner. The police were involved but she dropped all charges made.Kayleigh suffers regular seizures most of which occur during the night or about 5am, but she also experiences seizures during the day. She is seen by a consultant neurologist at The Nottingham Queens Medical Centre (Dr Singhal). Sometime after this event Kayleigh took an overdose of her epilepsy medication, following the breakdown of a relationship. She has now recovered from the overdose but has recently experienced a period of intense epileptic activity and non-epileptic activity (e.g. limbs twitching). Colleagues within the team have been supporting Miss Farnsworth with the adaptation of her property. Funds allocated in a Disability Facilities Grant have been used to adapt the bathroom of her property, to reduce the risk of injury should she experience epileptic activity. I have been asked to support Kayleigh to apply to charitable organisations to seek support with funding the purchase of appropriate flooring for the rest of her property (Living area, Hallway and bedroom). After seeking advice from Epilepsy Action it has become apparent that the most suitable flooring to place in Kayleighs property is vinyl/cushion flooring as she suffers with a range of seizures. This flooring would reduce the risk of injury such as friction burns should she experience epileptic activity. Kayleigh is a 27 years old, and the risk of such injury is of great concern to her. This flooring would complete the work to her property and allow her to focus upon the rest of her life.Yours sincerelySimon TurnerPromoting Independence WorkerPhysical Disability Team BGRNottinghamshire County Council";"2013-06-24 10:27:50";"2013-10-07 13:02:32";"1381147352"

She is 59 years old.-She first came to the UK in 1998 to visit, a year later she got a work visa.  After being given 3 years leave to remain in 2005, she got indefinite leave to remain in 2008 due to compassionate health grounds and for political reasons as she is from Matabeleland-an opposition area of Zimbabwe- and she was suffering from political prosecution. -Ms Nsimango was sick on and off and after her GP’s recommendation for taking the HIV test, she was diagnosed HIV positive in 2001. This diagnosis was a great shock to her; she is currently taking 3 anti HIV medications.- She also has lupus for which she takes warfarin to thin the blood and therefore prevent deep venous thrombosis, stroke, or heart attack. - Furthermore, she has been diagnosed with arthritis, which greatly reduces her mobility. Although she uses a walking stick when it flares up, she sometimes finds difficult to get out of the house.-All the above diagnoses have contributed to Ms Nsimango suffering from depression as the illnesses she suffers from make her more vulnerable and prone to isolation.-She used to work as a support worker in an old people’s residential home in London, a job that she very much enjoyed, as she was not only helping the elderly but she was also contributing to society in her new country. Unfortunately, because of her arthritis and lupus reducing her mobility, she had no choice but to stop working.-Ms Nsimango needs a microwave as the one she has does not work anymore. It is very important for her to have a microwave in order to warm up ready meals as with her illnesses she often find herself with not energy to cook. For an HIV+ person is crucial to have a balanced diet.  Appropriate diet helps the immune system and with a stronger immune system she will be able to better fight other illnesses.-The fact that she is on benefits and suffers from HIV, lupus, arthritis and depression means that she has to spend a great amount of her income on her health care, e.g. her home social care support from Barnet council. Hence, this leaves her virtually with no money to buy essential items to look after her health. ";"2013-06-26 14:00:13";"2013-06-26 14:00:13";NULL

She has recently moved into an unfurnished property with her three children.Due to her medical condition Eva is unable to work and relies on benefits. Unfortunately because she struggles to cover the needs of her family she has fallen into rent arrears of £2000. Eva is now repaying this debt by having £20 per week deducted from her income support.  She is also repaying a loan which she took out while living in emergency hotel accommodation to cover food bills. This is also being repaid at £20 per week. This leaves her in a very difficult financial situation and it is impossible for her to put any money aside to buy the necessary items for her new accommodation.Eva’s new home does not have any beds. The children are currently all sleeping on one mattress on the floor, which means they are unable to get a good night’s sleep. The two older children therefore struggle during the day finding it difficult to concentrate at school, so it is affecting their education. This adds to the stress which Eva is under and this in turn has an impact on her own health. The baby also needs a safe and secure place to sleep and is in need of a cot. We are also asking for funds for the mattresses and bedding which would be required for the new beds and a cot.If this application was successful it would also go some way in relieving the stress Eva feels from all her financial worries.

I am her mental health recovery worker from a day centre for people with severe and enduring mental health issues.  Sandra has been affected by a lot of issues in the past, including drug use, incarceration, bereavement and she has been raped by a policeman in the past. Sandra’s mother and father are both deceased and she has two daughters, one is 16 and the other is 26 (they are not really in contact).Sandra’s multiple problems mean her and her daughter have a very strained relationship.Sandra’s tendonitis is aggravated by the cold weather; she lives in a very old 3 floor, drafty house with very bad insulation and heating. The council has sent people by multiple times to fix her heating and radiators but they all tell her the same thing, that the radiators are too old and nothing can be done for this and that the whole system needs to be changed. Sandra’s mobility problems mean that it is very hard for her to get around her large house. Her heating bill is very high and Sandra says that sometimes she has to choose between eating or heating and sometimes lives off cereal biscuits. Her heating bill can reach up to £200 a month and she was previously £1000 in debt, but this has been written off. However she still had a lot of debts to pay off.Sandra is looking for better and smaller accommodation but as she fled the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, due to domestic violence, she is having an issue with finalising which council she belongs to. Sandra also is looking to have her bathroom fitted to assist with her mobility problems. I hope that if Sandra is approved for this grant, it can ease the pressure of her heating bills so that her tendonitis is eased and so she can be able to budget better and spend money on other things she needs, such as food and debt relief.

The condition has triggered a moderate brain injury, Epilepsy, concentration issues, poor short and long term memory and has reduced Jane's mobility so she needs a walking frame at times but mainly uses a walking stick.Neurosupport started working with Jane in December 2012. Jane had been out of education and employment for a long time and her confidence was really low. Jane has almost no social life at all and all her time was spent with family and carers. Jane has a complex number of support needs in relation to travel. The practical aspect of her physical travel access needs is accompanied by vulnerability caused by her memory, concentration and neurological fatigue as a result of her condition and the drowsy effect of the level of medication she takes daily. Jane also experiences grand mal / tonic-clonic seizures, which are not fully managed by her medication so she is unable to travel alone due to the severe nature of this condition. Jane has recently completed a Foundation Learning course in employability at Neurosupport and her confidence has improved greatly. In addition to this, Jane has made a few new friends which has greatly lifted her self esteem. Travel expenses where included in the delivery of this course provided by an external training organisation. Unfortunately the current Level 2 course is also provided externally by another organisation and Jane is really motivated to continue to build her confidence, continue to develop her social group by having regular interaction outside of her home life.The grant cost is based on a support worker picking Jane up from her house 4 times per week and escorting her to Liverpool to attend her sessions. The cost for this is £20 per day for 13 weeks, which works out as £1,040 and £166.40 for tunnel toll fees to cross the River mersey from her home in Bromborough. The course started on Tuesday 3rd July, and travel is currently being offered by staff volunteering to pick Jane up, however due to distance, finance and timing this is not available long term.

Up until a fall last year when she broke her leg she could walk indoors and was independent. She now has much more limited mobility and has limited ability to exercise without help. Please see further details in my colleague Jane Freebody's letter sent separately. Denise is a highly motivated lady and when she could, worked hard to provide for her family, maintain independence and paid for all alterations in her property, proactively thinking about her future needs as her mobility deteriorated. She was unfortunately made redundant 2 years ago and now has increased physical needs so therefore, financial capacity has been hugely decreased.  With this muscle problem the weakness increases and makes meaningful muscle function deteriorate with time. It is vital that muscles therefore, are exercised appropriately to maintain optimum strength and function. The overall benefits of exercise in the general population are well recognised. The Thera-Vital exercise bike will enable Denise to exercise from the chair appropriately and hopefully restore some of the weakness experienced while recovering from her leg break.

A referral has been made to Salford welfare rights and debt advice team. Steve Quinn, advice worker has been assigned to work with Lorraine. Lorraine would greatly appreciate your assistance to purchase additional nourishment-good quality fresh fruit, vegetables and meat. In addition, Lorraine would like to buy some new clothes. Lorraine is a plus size, over the last 12-18 months there has been no money in the household budget to buy them. At the moment Lorraine's confidence is very low and Lorraine feels as though she is a failure and she cannot see an end to her situation.

She separated from her husband in November last year. He is not supporting the family or giving her any money to help with children expenses. In February JSA was stopped as she could not seek for work anymore as she was in her last stages of her pregnancy. Since then she has applied fro Income support three times and she was always refused as they did not have enough evidences aboput the separation. I have started supporting with her last month; we have applied again, submitted more evidences and we are waiting for an answer (because of that Housing Benefit and Council Tax support have stopped and she needs to pay rent and Council Tax). Since February her only income has been Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit and she has been relying on food parcels from a local Foodbank or small handouts from friends. Ms. Semivumbi suffers from a chronic blood disease and she needs to take daily life saving medication. Side effects are fatigue and diziness, low mood and occasional night sweats. Ms. Semivumbi would need support for day to day expenses and especially for the expenses related to her children (formula milk, nappies, food, clothes). We support Ms. Semivumbi in integrating into the community, stay safe and independent and make a positive contribution. A financial support from you would mean that Ms. Semivumbi could purchase some clothes for the children and secure milk and nappies for her little son. Also, she would need a pushchair to be able to leave the property and be more independent. The separation has left her extremely vulnerable and managing the large family by herself is taking a lot from her emotionally, physically and psychologically. The stress induced by her current situation is having a negative impact on her adherence to treatment and is making her immune system weaker and more prone to potentially deadly infections. I would therefore be extremely grateful if you could award a grant to Ms. Semivumbi. ";"2013-07-15 12:08:30";"2013-08-29 15:24:28";"1377786268"

Each time Jane attempts to use the machine, grime builds in the machine making it worse than better.  Hence, clothes have to be rewashed several times, resulting in extra time, and cost for Jane.  Her ongoing living condition is having a detrimental affect on her mental health.  She also suffers with shermans disease and arthirtis in her knees, which means she is unable to stand to wash her clothes by hand.  Due to the back pain she is unable to sit whilst doing this either.  Jane lives with her 15 year old son, she feels extremely anxious to make sure everything is clean when he goes to school.  But this is having a detrimental affect on both her mental and physical health having to do this several times.  She only has a couple of clothes herself, due to not being able to afford new clothes for herself.  A grant for a washing machine would be greatly appreciated.";"2013-07-23 09:31:08";"2013-08-29 15:22:22";"1377786142"

She has been HIV positive since 2003 and a George House Trust service user since 2011. In 2012 she became seriously ill with an HIV related chest infection which has left her seriously debilitated.  Earlier this year we began to have concerns for her mental health and this reached a point where we advocated on her behalf to her college and funding body to suspend her studies on grounds of ill health without requiring her to make any financial repayment. Her condition worsened and she was sectioned under the mental health act and  admitted to hospital in July as an emergency case.  Whilst in hospital she had a lumbar puncture which has left her with pain in her back and down one leg. Although discharged from hospital, she is not deemed well enough to resume work or her studies and so is effectively financially destitute and, very worryingly, is accumulating rent, council tax, heat & light arrears and other bills. Whilst she says that she wishes to resume working,  the agency she was with will not re-engage her at present and so she may need to apply for benefits. Given her current state of mind, it is proving difficult to resolve these issues with Nomalanga and GHT is assisting her with emergency payments for food and bills. Additionally, she is suffering with serious medication side effects due to her HIV medication having been changed.  This was because she did not adhere to the required regime because of her mental health condition and she developed drug-resistance. Insomnia, disturbed sleep, chronic night sweats and nightmares are recognized HIV medication side effects and in her case these are compounded by her mental health condition.  Given her history of opportunistic infection and her night sweats , it is crucial to her HIV well-being that her bedding and clothing is hygienically clean at all times.  She has never had a washing machine and is no longer mentally or physically in a position to undertake an arduous journey by bus to a launderette. Providing her with a washing machine (approx £150 from Argos) will enable her to wash he bedding and clothing regularly and this activity of itself will  help with her mental rehabilitation and help re-build her confidence and self esteem.  Nomalanga will require a great deal of support over the coming months and providing her with a washing machine forms part of the support package for her.  I very much hope you will be able to support this application.";"2013-08-21 14:09:24";"2013-08-21 14:09:24";NULL

She is 57 years old.-She first came to UK in 1991 as student of hotel and catering.  Before finishing her studies she got a job as a secretary in the Malawi High Commission in order to support herself.When she first came to London she left her daughter back home in Zimbabwe; the daughter joined her here after six months. -Miss Sikipa got leave to remain in the UK in 1998.-She has always worked as a secretary or administrator, jobs that she very much enjoyed, as she was not only an efficient secretary but she felt that she was also contributing to society in her new country. -Grace  was diagnosed HIV+ in 2005 after being admitted in hospital as she was very ill.  She had a very weak immune system and had to go through different medical treatments.  She is currently on anti-retroviral combination therapy to treat HIV infection; however, these medications cause Miss Sikipa different sides effects including tiredness and fatigue. -In 2008 she was also diagnosed with Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV 1), though symptoms started a few years earlier in 2004 when she started having falls on the street and incontinence accidents. -One of the problems that HTLV 1 causes is bowel and bladder incontinence.  HTLV1 also affects the nerves of the spinal cord, therefore her mobility is greatly affected.  She gets very painful and stiff lower back and hips, heavy legs and numbness on the feet; as a result she has to use a walking stick for most of the time.  Unfortunately, there are not medications for HTLV1, the only thing she can do is to take painkillers such as ibuprofen, however this medication can also trigger asthma attacks.-Grace has been asthmatic for 14 years, hence she sometimes has breathing difficulties because of pollen and pollution, so she needs to use an inhaler.-Her daughter helps with all chores at home and with personal care e.g. showering.  -All the above diagnoses have contributed to Miss Sikipa suffering from depression and increased levels of anxiety as the illnesses she has make her feel more vulnerable and prone to isolation. -Due to all the health problems described previously, Grace had to stop working in 2009.-Miss Sikipa needs a gas cooker as the one she has is not working properly and therefore is dangerous.  For her it is very important to have a cooker in order to have a balanced diet; being HIV positive it is crucial to have cooked meals. Inappropriate diet will damage her immune system and this will make her more prone to suffer from another opportunistic illnesses. Also, having a balanced diet is important in ensuring that medications are absorbed and processed by the body, and in helping her weakened immune system.";"2013-08-21 17:04:11";"2013-08-21 17:04:11";NULL

She became pregnant early in 2010 and it was then that it was discovered she was HIV positive, during ante-natal HIV testing. Eucharia came to the UK as a dependent spouse; her husband was here studying at university. However, shortly after she received her HIV positive diagnosis her husband left the family home. She has not heard from him or seen him since he left her in July 2010. He does not provide any emotional or financial support for Eucharia or their son Ryan. This has been understandably hard for her to cope with as a single mum also dealing with her HIV diagnosis. Due to emotional trauma she developed depression and she now receives anti-depressants for her condition. Eucharia is not allowed to work and has no recourse to public funds due to her unresolved immigration status. She and Ryan are housed by Haringey Social services as part of their statutory responsibility for the child. Their only financial support is £50 a week from Haringey Social Services and £10 a week from Cara for Ryan’s food. She spends £19.60 a week for travel to take her son to nursery school. The rest of the money is spent on food and clothing.Eucharia volunteers and attends our Positive Women’s Group. She is well-liked by the whole group as she always tries to be cheery and friendly with everyone. Ryan is also a welcome addition to the group, he has such an infectious smile when he is at the group and cheers everyone up when they see him. Eucharia’s contribution to the group is highly valued by Cara and members of the group. She helps set up the room ready for everyone to arrive and then does the washing up after lunch and tidy the room on a weekly basis. In addition she cooks for the whole group once a month.Poverty and uncertainty significantly affect their lives as they are living on limited resources. Eucharia tries to rebuild her health and provide a better future for her son and believes that Leave to Remain in UK would help her become part of society and provide her and her son with stability. She is committed to remaining in the UK and is still hopeful of making a valuable contribution to this country through her intention to obtain employment once she has her citizenship under control.";"2013-09-04 18:00:36";"2013-10-04 11:18:34";"1380881914"

She is subsequently trying to adapt her home to meet her changing needs. Since the amputation Ms Browning has been wheelchair bound. She therefore lacks movement to keep herself warm especially in the winter months. Ms Browning lives in an old property which does not provide any insulation/double glazing. Ms Browning is in need of some assistance to keep her home warm, she does not have central heating. Her usual method of heating is the agar, based in the kitchen. Unfortunately Ms Browning is no longer able to sleep in the kitchen and has had to move her bedroom away from the agar, consequently lacking warmth. Ms Browning requires some assistance financially to invest in a more effective method of heating. In addition, due to being wheelchair bound Ms Browning required adapted technology to enable her to complete activities of daily living safely. Currently Ms Browning uses a gas stove with dials to turn on/off on a back board above the stove. Consequent to leaning over the stove Ms Browning has incurred burns and would really benefit from a cooking facility that would enable her to enable to cook meals with minimal risk of burning (controls at front of system) so that she can maintain her current level of independence.

As she wants to return to a particular small place in Ireland where her family are from it is looking less and less likely that she will get offered housing there unfortunately. Ms Brown has never asked for any kind of help; it was one of her cousins that phoned us to express concern about Kathleen and to see if there was anything we could do to help her. The next time I saw her I raised this as subtly as I could as I did not want to risk offending her, but chatting to her it transpired that she has a very old cooker that does not work properly and as a result she is afraid to use it, she generally just manages with a microwave. She also does not have a washing machine and washes all her sheets and towels by hand in the sink. She is unable to go to the launderette due to her arthritis as there are stairs leading up to her flat that she has difficulty managing and she would not be able to climb up and down carrying washing. I advised Kathleen about sheltered housing options and this is something she may consider in the future; she also advises that her flat is very large with high ceilings and so is expensive for her to heat in the winter, another reason why she may end up having to move. I advised her that there was help out there and asked her which of the two items would be more important to her; she advised it would be a new cooker that she would not be afraid to use; I had to virtually force her to choose as she felt so bad about asking for any kind of help! I advised her that that are what charities and grants are there for, to help people with essential items.  Along with her arthritis, Ms Brown also gets incredibly depressed as her daughter, who she was incredibly close to, died of breast cancer some years ago, we have frequently seen her in tears over the years when she has spoken to us about her daughter.Due to Ms Browns difficulties it would be absolutely lovely if you could assist her with the price of a gas cooker. I have included in the price the extra amount needed to install & deliver cooker and take away her current old appliance. If the application is successful, could I also please point out that we have merged with another charity now so the cheque would need to be made payable to The London Irish Centre.

She has indefinite leave to remain.  Initially, Deena found employment at the FACT cinema, however, the employment was temporary and this ended in December 2009. She later found employment with an agency and began lecturing at John Moores University.  We identified that she may be eligible to apply for assistance from Recourse/Teacher Support Network.  However, on further investigation, she does not meet their eligibility criteria as she was only temped in as supply and didn't work for at least 2 days per week  and for at least one term.  Deena herself had made an application to the Eaton Fund but tells us that the application was unsuccessful.At present, she is unable to work due to the side effects of the fibroid and her impending surgery.  She has also been advised that she will need 6 weeks to recover from the surgery.Deena seperated from her husband in January 2013.  Her brother in law took his own life in February 2010 and this took a massive toll on both her and her husbands relationship and unfortunately, their relationship began to decline gradually until they seperated and he left the property.  This left Deena in a position where the household income was reduced.  She made a claim for Jobseekers Aloowance and when she began to experience the side effects of the fibroid, made a claim for ESA.  She was placed in the assessment phase and was in receipt of £71.70 per week.  As a result of the reduced income, she began to accrue electricity and rent arrears.She now has a payment plan in place and is repaying the arrears at a rate of £3.60 per week in addition to her ongoing consumption.  We have made an application to the British Gas Energy Trust on her behalf.She has some rent arrears and is also repaying the arrears at £3.60 per week to stop any possession proceedings.In light of the above information and circumstances, we would ask that Deena be considered worthy of a grant towards the requested needs from Margaret's.  An award of a grant will have a positive impact on her life, enable her to purchase the requested needs and prevent further debt.After essential expenditure, she has no surplus income in which to purchase the items.

We need to buy beds for the girls, as my partner has 2 children, and other bedroom items for them as well as the fence. there are lots of roaming dogs in the area and we dont want one coming into the garden area when Hollie is there as she cant run away from one, so we need to be at her side constantly for the moment. We would hope to have some assistance in this, but if you are unable to help then please can you advise on who can help.I am under the gp for some mental health issues which are due to the dire housing situation we have been in with Anti-social behaviour for 2 years. I have had cancer in 2009 and subsequently have paranoia about its return. I am not well at the moment due to stress and will behaving CBT with my local health service as soon as an appointment is available.I hope you can help us in some way.Kind regards,Rachel Robinson";"2013-10-19 13:51:01";"2013-11-27 13:23:47";"1385558627"

She is uses a wheelchair and relies on her scooter to access local shops and amenities and to escort her children to school.Joanne bought her scooter second hand as she was unable to fund a new one, and as a result it is not under guarantee. Joanne’s scooter recently broke down, and whilst it was in for repair, the engineer advised her that her tyres are dangerously worn and not safe to use. Joanne has no way to finance new tyres, she is working hard to pay off existing debt and is faced with having to take out a loan in order to pay for her scooter to be put back in working order. The cost of each tyre including fitting is £80, so Joanne is faced with a bill of £320 that she cannot afford to pay.Joanne is currently frightened to leave the house on her scooter due to the lack of grip on her tyres, and this fear will only worsen as the weather becomes colder. Joanne is nervous that icy pavements will be dangerous for her to travel on without adequate grip on her tyres. She is currently only going out on essential trips and using taxis to avoid travelling long distances on her scooter. Joanne’s son Joshua has a number of behavioural problems, meaning that he does not cope well with being confined at home, and his behaviour is getting increasingly difficult for Joanne to manage without being able to get out and about with him. Joanne has previously experienced considerable domestic abuse perpetrated by the father of her children and has worked hard to regain her independence after leaving this relationship. Although she presents as resilient, she suffers from depression, and I am concerned that her loss of independence may cause her mood and mental health to deteriorate.Therefore, Joanne has asked me to support her to apply to you for financial assistance for Joanne to purchase replacement tyres for her scooter, and I would be extremely grateful if you would consider granting Joanne support. Please do get in touch with me if you require further information.";"2013-10-21 12:15:54";"2013-11-27 13:25:07";"1385558707"

Janet needs a mobility scooter as she is not able to walk more than a few meters without needing to stop. As a result of diabetes Janet's circulation is poor and causes her legs to cramp. The physio has provided a walking stick however this is not suitable for Janet to walk to the shops with as she needs to be able to take her shopping home too! The physio advised hiring a scooter however Janet cannot afford this nor can she afford a taxi when she needs to see her GP or if she wanted to go to a bigger supermarket to save money on food. Janet applied for PIP in August and we are awaiting their decision of award. Awarding Janet the money to by a mobility scooter will enable Janet to access her community, combat social isolation, improve her mental health and quality of life.

Sharon was referred to SNAP as she was severely struggling with her finances. She accrued rent, council tax arrears and had an extremely large number of non priority debts. Sharon suffers from severe depression and anxiety. She is unable to go out of her home without taking diazepam and regularly experiences severe panic attacks.  Leaving her home leaves Sharon in a serious state which triggers panic attacks and leaves her feeling unwell for the remainder of the day. She has dealt with this for at least 20 years. Sharon has found it even harder to cope even with the smallest daily activities following the death of her husband 4 years ago. Sharon heavily relies on her mental health worker, myself and her daughters to manage her daily life.Sharon recently (two weeks ago) had to give up a long term fostering placement due to her ill health, which reduced her income dramatically. She is struggling even more to pay for even her most necessary bills. Sharon had to inform tax credits that she was no longer fostering which revoked her entitlement with immediate effect. Her ESA has yet to be increased to £71.70 so is only living on £19 per week ESA and £150 housekeeping her daughter gives her. DWP anticipates a further 3-4 weeks before her benefits will increase. I have completed an application for PIP with Sharon but have been advised that it may be months before they will be able to complete a face to face assessment with her.Sharon is currently going through a bankruptcy via the local citizens’ advice bureau to clear her arrears.  But she is greatly concerned that she will be unable to pay for her fees on such limited income. Please can you consider help towards food and credit for Sharon's electric meter? I am greatly concerned Sharon will be left without heating in the cold weather and in turn her already fragile mental health will deteriorate further. Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated. ";"2013-11-07 10:11:38";"2013-12-02 12:52:20";"1385988740"

Mrs Watkins is suffering from a lot of pain from her arthritis and has been housebound due to her condition and having to rely on her husband to take her anywhere.

We have supported Stephanie in gaining temporary furnished accommodation through Ayr Council.  The cost of this flat is £600 per calendar month.  Stephanie is eligible for £370 housing benefit with the shortfall of £230 per month.  In addition to this her heating costs are expensive as the flat has storage heating; Stephanie had to put £50 in the meter over a week’s period. Stephanie suffers from asthma and Cystic Fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis is a life limiting inherited condition which is both complex and progressive. Cystic Fibrosis affects the mucus producing glands of the body, mainly the lungs and pancreas, causing malnutrition and chest infections that result in permanent lung damage. The condition makes it difficult to maintain dietary requirements and people with Cystic Fibrosis can often be small and thin compared to their peers. A permanent, distinctive cough which disrupts sleep and excessive sweating are also common characteristics of the condition. There is no cure for Cystic Fibrosis and the current average life expectancy is around 35-38 years, with many young people dying in their late teens and early twenties. Stephanie’s health is monitored by a specialist hospital-based medical team in Glasgow, but the bulk of her care is delivered at home. In the meantime she requires a rigorous daily treatment regime which is designed to help her cope with a greatly reduced lung function. The treatment includes physiotherapy at least twice a day to clear thick secretions from her lungs and minimise deterioration in lung function. She also has oral and nebulised antibiotics daily for the prevention and treatment of repeated chest infections.  She also has to maintain a high calorie diet, taken with special enzymes, to avoid weight loss.Her present lung function is now only about 55% and so she suffers from breathlessness after very little exertion.  This is why she needs to be housed on the ground floor level of a property, because she cannot cope with stairs.Because of her condition she needs to be housed in an environment which is consistently warm, as significant variations will make her breathing much worse.  The fact she is living in temporary accommodation which she can’t afford is causing her considerable anxiety and creating feelings of depression. There is much research evidence that stress/anxiety significantly inhibits a person’s response to treatment, and I hope it is clear how vital the effectiveness of her treatment regime is to her health status. Stephanie needs to cover the shortfall of her rent which is £460.00 for the two months she is expected to be in her temporary home and she is struggling, she needs help in covering this unexpected additional cost of the expensive heating system and we ask if you could help her by providing a grant of £100 towards the costs.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the UK's most common life-threatening inherited diseases, affecting around 9000 people in the UK. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a single defective gene. As a result, the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, become clogged with thick sticky mucus resulting in chronic infections and inflammation in the lungs and difficulty digesting food. The new statistics show that the median expected survival rate for people with cystic fibrosis in the UK has increased to 43.5 years, due in large part to improvements in treatment and standards of specialist care.Kerstin reports that she has both respiratory and abdominal symptoms in equal measure and that she manages her condition to a degree by following a very restricted diet, and by taking particular vitamins and supplements.  In addition to CF Kerstin also has trigeminal neuralgia, emphysema, mitrostenosis, sleeping problems and fatigue.Kerstin lives in a one bed council flat and is receipt of housing and council tax benefit, and Income Support, awaiting a transfer to Employment and Support Allowance.  Kerstin is therefore on a very limited income of £102.70 pwk  and on paper her expenditure is £102 pwk.   Due to her significant health conditions, hoarding tendencies and the loss of a friend who was assisting her, Kerstin’s flat is now in need of a complete clear out. I have been quoted £400 to complete this work and any contribution towards this would be greatly appreciated.  If successful, a cheque should be made payable to University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. Following this work ongoing floating support from housing is being sought to prevent this re-occurring.  Due to her financial situation Kerstin has no funds to be able to pay for this work, and due to her health condition does not have the physical ability to now tackle it.";"2013-11-19 15:28:58";"2013-12-02 14:16:26";"1385993786"

In childhood the condition affects mainly the functioning of the lungs and pancreas.  People who have it suffer from chronic lung disease and pancreatic inefficiency creates malabsorption problems that cause them to be malnourished.  As they age other organs become affected causing additional problems that include diabetes, arthritis and liver disease.  Cystic Fibrosis is a progressive condition for which there is no cure and the current average life expectancy for someone with the condition is around the mid 30’s.  Ms Savage requires a daily treatment regime that is designed to slow the inevitable progression of the disease.  This includes physiotherapy to clear thick secretions from her chest; antibiotics to treat repeated chest infections that leave permanent tissue damage in her compromised lungs; nebulised and intravenous medication to open airways and relieve breathlessness, treat inflammation and infection; special diet with vitamin supplements and pancreatic enzymes to aid digestion and prevent weight loss.  All of this treatment is delivered at home.Since treatment takes place at home, the home environment is an essential aspect of providing adequate care in terms of space, hygiene, temperature and environment.  Her home is presently unsuitable due to the lack of heating and hot water.  This would be unhealthy for anyone but poses a more serious risk to Ms Savage’s health because her lungs are compromised by cystic fibrosis.  Having no heating exacerbates breathing difficulties for people with cystic fibrosis who ought to live in a dry, warm, consistent atmosphere.  Extremes of hot and cold are incompatible with the needs of someone with a chronic lung disease.Despite maintaining her treatment regime at home this Ms Savage has reduced lung function and also has 5 different types of bacteria in her lungs which are particularly difficult to eradicate.  This increases her vulnerability to chest infections, her health is declining.  She suffers from constant fatigue and varied levels of breathlessness.  The fragile nature of her condition means that she already lives with more than the average amount of anxiety and stress, and it is imperative that she maintains the positive attitude and well-being to be responsible for this rigorous daily regime.  Despite advances in treatment which have enabled a large proportion of people with Cystic Fibrosis to reach adulthood, the condition remains a progressive illness for which there is no cure and treatment will remain necessary throughout Ms Savage’s life.  Failure to have appropriate heating would quickly lead to deterioration in her health and would ultimately be life-threatening.Our aim is to support people living with cystic fibrosis to enable them to receive the best possible home care.  Stacy presently lives in a house she connot afford since the split from her husband.  Consequently we would respectfully request that special consideration be given in relation to Ms Savage’s grant application for £120 towards the cost of bulk gas.Ms Savage’s condition will not improve but will continue to deteriorate.  Having hot water and heating will make Ms Savages home more suitable for her considerable care needs and very much hope you will be able to help.Ms Savage is in receipt of income support, ESA (support group) and DLA care and mobility component.  The mobility component is used for a disability car.We will be pleased to provide any further information that will assist you in making any decisions.

Eva has suffered great financial hardship since her husband passed away last year and has been struggling to make ends meet.  As well as coping with the loss of her husband of 42 years Eva's health and mobility has has deteriorated greatly in the last year to the extent she finds walking to the shop at the end of her road an arduous task.  Her decrease in mobility has led to Eva being extremely isolated as she can no longer use public transport as a means of getting around and cannot afford the luxury of taxis on a regular basis.  As there is a good community spirit in Eva's area and a few activities that would be good for her isolation I am submitting this application for a mobility scooter as this would have an extremely positive impact on all areas of Eva's life s it would give her the independence that she needs to live her life and the scooter is an item that without financial assistance from yourselves she would never be able to afford.";"2013-12-11 14:45:35";"2014-01-13 10:59:12";"1389610752"

She has strived to develop her academic interests, and has a BA with Honours in Criminology from the London Metropolitan University. Unfortunately Celia has suffered ill health in recent years and has been unable to find paid work for some time, which has had a negative effect on her confidence and self esteem. However she has continued her volunteering role, assisting former and disabled servicemen via the SSAFA charity. Celia is also involved in other local community organisations that provide information, advice and peer support to disabled people. Celia requires a new laptop as her old one is beyond repair, she used it in her work with SSAFA and it is an essential tool for communication and managing her impairment, and as a source of information that can assist her in all aspects of daily life. I hope the Fund may be able to assist Celia as the laptop is her main avenue of communication and inclusion within the wider community.

Louise finds it difficult to leave the family home and access to a computer would enable her to be able to buy groceries and other purchases the family need.  Louise's young son also needs to be able to complete homework tasks on a computer.  I would be very grateful of your consideration in this application for a very deserving lady.";"2014-01-06 12:52:19";"2014-01-23 12:19:24";"1390479564"

She is supported by the Bow and Poplar Community Mental Health Team, as well as the Family Action Building Bridges service. I have been working with Samantha and her Carer (Father - Michael Dick) at the request of Bow and Poplar Community Mental Health Team since September 2013. Mr Michael Dick  is a full time carer to his 4 year old grandson Connor, and he is also a carer to his daughter Samantha. He has been caring full-time for Samantha, for many years and since her mental health worsened six months ago and she was hospitalised. Michael decided to let Connor move in with him, rather than him be taken into care by Social Services. Michael was assessed by Social Services as being an appropriate carer for Connor. Despite Samantha being released from hospital two months ago Micheal will remain Connor's carer for the foreseeable future, as there are significant concerns about Samantha’s ability to parent Connor alone safely. Samantha is also living with her Father since hospital discharge. They are on a low income, as Father is on only a state pension. Furthemore Samantha only receives ESA, her DLA was stopped as she was in hosiptal and missed medical assessments. Due to their low income they cannot afford to buy Samantha any new clothing, and her current clothing is looking very worn out. Any spare pounds left at the end of the month goes towards buying Connor's essential clothing items. As a worker supporting this family I can honestly state that a clothing grant is needed.";"2014-01-08 15:29:34";"2014-01-23 15:26:31";"1390490791"

In 2012 she fell and broke her polio affected leg during a dizzy spell and was hospitalised for some time. Additionally she broke her caliper last year when she fell again. This makes her very nervous about going out without assistance particularly in wet/icy conditions. A social worker who was involved in the past apparently tried to get a mobility scooter for her from statutory sources without success. Using an ordinary wheelchair is difficult due to pains in her shoulders. If she had a scooter her level of  independence and quality of life would be greatly improved. her psychological state is exacerbated by having to be in the house a great deal; she could also accompany her small son to school instead of relying on a state funded carer and she could also take him out at other times.  She would clearly need some kind of assessment for the right type of scooter for her needs.  As her psychotherapist I support wholeheartedly her application and believe it would greatly improve her psychological well being as well as assisting her mobility.

Miss Conway has a long standing history of vulnerability issues that have impacted on her ability to cope with her affairs generally and her finances in particularly.  She now has significant high levels of rent arrears £2272.37 which is being reduced via a payment arrangement of £19.70 per week. She feels that her finances are strained but most of all due to ill health she feels confused by the demands that are made on her just to get by. Miss Conway has limited literacy skills and requires hep to understand correspondence and bills. I am currently supporting Miss Conway to address some of these long outstanding issues. A combination of physical and mental health problems have cut Miss Conway working life short and this appears to be a source of regret and frustration for her.  These feelings in turn only add to the severity of her health problems.  Miss Conway has suffered with Lupus for 12 years, she explained that condition causes rashes on her skin, mouth ulcers and sticky eyes. She also suffers with Arthritis  in her knees and arms.  She says that her joints are tremendously painful at times. She also has high blood pressure which attributes to all the medication she is taking. Miss Conway is waiting on a hip replacement however her GP is yet to make a referral to the hospital. Miss Conway reports suffering from depression for years since loosing her job. She admits to feeling very angry and frustrated at not being able to work and finds it difficult to move beyond these feelings.  Miss Conway cannot use public transport and reports to me that her quality of life and independence would improve greatly with the use of a  mobility scooter, however she does not have the financial ability to purchase one as all of her DLA goes towards paying off her debts. I have been supporting Miss Conway since October 2013 when she was identified by Genesis Housing Association as a vulnerable tenant needing assistance.If any further information is required regarding this application; please contact me on 033 3000 3000/07525 904093.";"2014-01-29 16:07:50";"2014-04-30 17:30:29";"1398875429"

Hammersmith Hospital performed a procedure to try and divide the adhesions but had no success, advising that nothing further could be done and pain management was the only course of action now available.  Since then she has lost her husband to cancer which has left her suffering from severe depression.  She is on a large amount of daily pain killers and then has supplementary pain relief to take on particularly bad days, she also takes anti depressants and is awaiting counselling.  Mrs Sarsons is reliant on walking sticks to get her around the house and has perching stools and a shower stool to help with daily tasks.  She used to be a very active and outgoing person but the pain combined with the depression has her living as a recluse, often not getting out of bed during the day.  Mrs Sarsons misses getting out and about in the fresh air and I feel that a mobility scooter will allow her the freedom of getting independently to the shops or going out for some fresh air without having to be reliant on someone driving her, or her suffering from pain the next day due to over exertion.  She does have some savings but as you can see her weekly outgoings exceed her weekly incomings at present because her ESA payments have been stopped due to the fact that she has been put into the work related group instead of the support group.  We are appealing against this but as you are aware the process takes time and in the meanwhile she is using her savings to live on.";"2014-02-07 16:28:42";"2014-04-30 17:28:37";"1398875317"

Jackie is wheel chair dependant and has a degenerative condition affecting her lumber and spine causing her constant pain.  She also suffers from anxiety and depression.  We have medical confirmation of this from her Doctor and can provide this if you need it.Jackie is struggling to cope independently and has contacted the local authority to ask for help.  Our Occupational Therapist team have visited Jackie to see how they could help.  They have been able to provide some aids and adaptations but are unable to provide all the items Jackie needs. Jackie’s currently has a low bed, and whilst she has now been shown how to transfer independently from her chair to her bed, using a board her bed is too low and cannot be raised safely, so Jackie continues to rely on family members to assist her. Jackie would like help to purchase a new higher bed.  She feels it would be prudent to purchase a bed which will accommodate her needs in the future and as the Doctor has confirmed that she has a degenerative disorder she feels an electric profiling bed would be the most beneficial for now and the future. She currently has an occasional bad day when her pain is so sever she cannot move, and whilst her current condition does not meet the criteria for a profiling bed she fears that her needs are increasing.Jackie has a limited income and has considerable debts, dating back six years when she was working.  She is currently seeking debt advice and considering declaring herself bankrupt as this is adding to her anxiety. Jackie lives with her 21 year old son, who has a mild learning disability.  Jackie supports him by organising his money and he provides physical support for her assisting her in transfers. Her son is currently on Job seekers allowance as he is hoping to find work on a building site as he has in the past.

Because of her lack of immigration status, she is ineligible for support from public sources and has exceeded the extent to which the Terrence Higgins Trust and George House Trust can help her financially. Duduzellah came to the UK from Zimbabwe on a 6 month visitor’s visa in March 2011.  Whilst she was over here, she received information that her business premises and home had been raided by the security police and that her computer and other items had been taken.  She became too frightened to return to Zimbabwe and applied for asylum in the UK.   So far, her claim has been unsuccessful and she would normally have no recourse to public funds.  However, because of her serious ill health she is in receipt of NASS (National Asylum Support Services)  support, which provides her with accommodation and £35 a week in vouchers for food and personal toiletries. Duduzellah was diagnosed HIV positive in Zimbabwe in November 2003 and was placed on medication.  However, the range of medication available in Zimbabwe is limited and when she was seen at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) she had a dangerously low CD4 cell count and a very high viral load.  She had developed a resistance to the medication she had been on and has now been placed on a special combination therapy regime.   In 2011 she developed a painful growth in her back which was found to be cancerous and lead to Seroma and Haematomas.   By 2013 the cancer had spread into her abdomen and she was operated on and also had radiotherapy.  She is still not in remission and has to attend regular active surveillance hospital appointments and also regular HIV check-ups at the MRI sexual health clinic.  Her cancer is HIV related and has left her very debilitated.  She is constantly fatigued and in pain and has mobility problems as a consequence. It is likely that because of the limited amount of food and other essentials she can purchase with her vouchers, she is failing to eat a properly nutritious diet, which may not only compromise further her HIV wellbeing but is probably a factor in her fatigue. The NASS accommodation in which Duduzellah has been placed is in Wigan but her hospital and HIV clinic are in Manchester, as is also George House Trust (GHT).  She is a regular attender at GHT for peer support and other services.   She cannot always travel to her appointments by public transport due to her ill health and a grant from the Margaret’s Fund will assist with this and her need for food and thereby help minimise further deterioration in her health.";"2014-02-28 13:40:33";"2014-02-28 13:40:33";NULL

She was hospitalised and it was then discovered that she was HIV+ and was suffering with pneumonia.  She subsequently became seriously ill with gastrointestinal problems and was hospitalised for four months following surgery which left her fitted with a colostomy bag.   In 2013 she had a further operation to reverse the stoma which went seriously wrong due to other complications which developed.  She spent four months up to November 2013 in hospital and although now discharged she still has the stoma and colostomy as well as a hernia and will require a further operation.  Having fallen ill so soon after coming to Manchester, she had no permanent place of abode and was placed in a homeless hostel following her hospital discharge.  She has now been placed in a a self-contained hostel flat which is of a very poor standard.  It has no shower and a bath which is damaged beyond use and it is also very cold and has old, ill-fitting windows.  All these factors seriously aggravate her medical conditions.   Her colostomy, stoma and hernia cause her considerable sanitary and hygiene problems.  Sometimes her bag will burst and she has seepage from all three conditions.  She is lacking warm bedding and a waterproof protector but she really needs more than one set of sheets and duvet in view of the regular soiling which takes place.  She also needs underwear and clothing for the same reason.  Not only is her health extremely poor and fragile at present, but her personal dignity has been all but completely eroded by the soiling which accompanies her medical conditions.  As if that were not enough, she is extremely depressed by the poor standard of accommodation in which she has been placed.  George House Trust is advocating on her behalf with the relevant authorities to effect improvements in her care and accommodation but this inevitably takes time and in the meantime some money for bedding and clothing will make a fantastic difference not just to her health by helping to improve her overall hygiene but will also impact positively on her personal dignity and HIV wellbeing.

In addition she has a lot of pain especially at old fracture sites. She finds it very difficult to use her current wheelchair on public transport and has fallen out of her wheelchair. She has told us that currently-”Life is very stressful and can sometimes feel like a burden”With a new powered wheelchair which meets her needs it will be much easier for her to get out and about. Everyday activities like reaching cupboards will be easier because of the elevation. Her stays in hospital after fractures and operations will be reduced as she will often still be able to use her powered wheelchair. She is planning to go to university and her new powered wheelchair will be absolutely essential to enable her to do this.Tobi is a very determine young lady and told us “I am very proud to have been the first disabled adult to pass my practical in GCSE Dance with an A*. I would like to start my own dance company, similar to the work of Cando Dance Company which includes both able bodied and disabled dancers”Tobi has had a specialised assessment of her needs by a specialist Occupational.

Social Services have been involved as it was not safe for Gemma to remain living at home any longer.  we have  found Gemma a one bedroom flat, and arranged a daily package of support as Gemma will need a lot of  help and support to set up her home and regain her confidence.  At present Gemma is living at the flat and has received a delivery of furniture from St Vincents consisting of a bed, some bedding a two seater setee a small table and a microwave.  These are all the household possessions she owns, when I visited her she was eating sweetcorn from an open tin. Please would you consider offering Gemma a grant to help set up her home. Gemma is not receiving any support from her family at present, she is receiving a package of care from the local authority to support her through this difficult time and has recently started working voluntarily at Oxfam, please could you offer her some financial assistance through this difficult period of her life.   Gemma receives ESA amounting to £121.65, DLA Care of £53.00 and DLA mobility of £21.00. She has a package of care and help with financial support from Citizenship First, she contributes £65.81 per week for this support. After her bills and living cost she has only £25.00 per week left.

She has to use wheelchair or scooter outdoors. Since batteries for her scooter stopped working she is not able to use it and as she cannot travel in a wheelchair without assistance she is now confined to her flat. Ida needs 2 batteries which cost £90 each. Ida has a diagnosis of clinical depression. She suffered it for many years following physical and sexual abuse as a child. Not being able to leave her home without assistance puts Ida into additionally stressful situation and has a negative impact on her mental health. Also, Ida recently moved in to a new property, which was supposed to be adjusted to her needs. However, after moving in, she discovered that the property is equipped with a bathtub instead of easily accessible shower cabin. To be able to use the bathtub comfortably Ida needs a shower board, so that she can take a shower in a sitting position. After her stomach operation in Chile in April 2013 her ESA was stopped and only restored recently. That put Ida through additional financial hardship and left with no funds available for the necessities such as batteries for the scooter or the shower board. Ida will not be able to address these needs on her own and will appreciate any help that might improve her living conditions. ";"2014-03-17 15:47:01";"2014-05-09 17:20:11";"1399652411"

This debt is being managed by the Step Change Charity and Sophia is keen to pay these debts off. However, as can be seen by her income and expenditure, her outgoings far outweigh her income. I was horrified to find out last week that Sophia’s cooker stopped working around three months ago and that her heating is broken. I asked how she had been managing and she explained that she had relied on the kindness of friends and sandwiches. I am writing to you today to help raise funds for a new cooker and the cost of having this fitted. I am seeking funds from other charities in regard to her heating.I have helped Sophia to prepare an income and expenditure form and have copies of her bank statements and savings. I am happy to forward these to you. I have also identified a cooker in Argos at a cost of £219 (full price £339). I have a quote for the oven to be fitted for a cost of £100.

The front door does not fully close all of the time and there have been occasions where wheelie bins were used to keep it shut. The force of the weather in extreme conditions has also added to its detriment. The porch is made of wood and is rotting which is why it needs to be replaced entirely. The patio doors are over 30 years old and do not lock properly. The chrome frames are not insulated which cause the panels to be cold both inside and outside.

It is a community based mental health team for people with severe and enduring mental health issues. Lumnie Gashie has been known to our service since December 2012 and was referred by the Primary Care Mental Health Team who she had been seeing for some weeks prior. Her consultant psychiatrist is Dr. Annie Hall.This lady has a history of hearing voices dating back to 2005.  She was hit by a car in 2007 when she lost consciousness and was admitted to hospital for a week in her country of origin.  She described dizzy spells, poor memory and concentration after this incident.  She has witnessed atrocities in Albania and her family were apparently in hiding for a number of years.  Additionally she has been in an extremely abusive relationship with her ex husband who has continued to threaten her and following an alleged assault in December 2012 she took the children and left the family home in Islington and has been homeless ever since moving from temporary accommodation to temporary accommodation. The family have finally been allocated a more permanent home but currently only have limited furniture and no real access to funds to buy things. When she came to our service she was suffering from a depressive disorder, current episode was severe.  She also had symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and psychotic symptoms, which could be related to either her trauma or she may have a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia concurrent to her other problems.  All her symptoms were made worse by stress and indeed her situation has been extremely adverse.  She had no benefits and no income at the time of presentation to us.  She had very little in the way of social support and was struggling to manage day to day life.  She has required intensive involvement from the Community Mental Health Team and from Children & Family Social Services, as well as reengagement with her family (sister).  She has been treated with antipsychotic medication, antidepressant medication and anxiolytics and has had a prolonged period under the Home Treatment Team, which is the most intensive form of community input we are able to provide, short of an inpatient admission.  She has suffered severe auditory and visual hallucinations through this time, as well as severe symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder with a recurrent intrusive imagery, recurrent nightmares waking her up several times in the night and high levels of anxiety.

She uses a walking stick to move around her house. When she has to go out she only uses her car and she makes sure that there are parking spaces very close to her destination as she is not able to walk far. She often has to ask neighbours or people met on the street to help her walk to the car, which is usually parked just on the other side of the street from her flat. Because of the extensive use of the car Elaine ends up spending huge chunk of her weekly income on fuel and car maintenance. When Elaine wants to do small shopping she often tries to walk to the nearest store. Her mobility issues are recently so severe that she suffered from frequent falls and is going to be assessed in the Fall Clinic. Elaine relies on her daughter to do bigger weekly shopping for her or with her. 	Elaine needs the seated walker not only because that would make her more independent e.g. by allowing her to do shopping on her own or walk easily from and to car; she would also be able to use it as a form of an exercise. She would be able to go for a walk around the neighbourhood without stressing that she would fall or get too tired to comfortably come back – she would not only have a walking support, but also a seat to fall back on whenever she feels too tired. This particular seated walker (Solo Rollator) was brought to Elaine’s attention by the occupational therapy. Elaine was informed that it would greatly benefit her to have one, she was also able to try one for herself, and she claims she was comfortable using it. However, occupational therapy is not able to provide Elaine with such a device. Elaine herself, having no savings or money to spare on week to week basis, also will not be able to buy one. Also, there is possibility that Elaine’s expenses will grow even higher. She is currently under occupying by one bedroom, the rent shortfall is, for now, covered by discretionary housing payment, but the payments have to be renewed on year to year basis.  Having this seated walker would greatly increase Elaine’s independence and life standard, provide a source of much needed exercise and allow her to spend more time outside.

She suffers with epilepsy and has had 6 fits in the last 6 months most of which have led to hospital admissions. She also suffers with severe depression and having completed detox has a daily methadone prescription which she has to collect 6 days of the week from the chemists. She is trying to re-establish her life and work to overcome these problems, with support.She receives ESA and had been put into the Support Group in recent months. She has had a number of years of a very unsettled lifestyle, including living in supported housing until approx April 2013. She has completed in-house detox for drug related issues. She then moved into a private tenancy with health and safety issues not addressed by the landlord including unsafe wiring, no electricity cut off switch, insecure back door with panel missing, severe damp issues and uneven flooring causing added risk due to her dizzy spells and risk of fits. This situation has led to a recent move in a hurry as the situation was having such a detrimental effect on her health. Due to recent moving costs she has had no money for essential items including gas, electricity and TV licence. We have assisted her to obtain a cooker and fridge from the Council’s social fund but she is very much in need of help to obtain  carpeting for the two downstairs living rooms (two rooms of an old terrace type house), plus a bedroom carpet. Because of the risk of fits with little warning it is very important that she gets adequate flooring.She is attending weekly for support from Chepstow House which is a centre for vulnerable women and includes regular CAB Outreach.  Any award made  will be spent under the supervision of a support worker. She also needs help to obtain a washer and other kitchen items – we are applying to other charities for to ask for help with these items.She can be at risk of incontinence when fitting which leads to some extra washing costs and is struggling to afford laundrette costs at present.She has already applied for a Budgeting Loan for help towards the £150 deposit still owing and is waiting to hear about this.Notes for financial statement-She has applied to the Council for Housing Benefit and just heard that she has been granted a Discretionary Housing Payment for a temporary period so that the rent is fully covered at present. (Her full rent is £91 a week and she is only entitled to the shared room rate of LHA which is currently £48.10 per week as she is single and under age 35). -Please note that we have not been able to indicate this on the financial statement so it appears she has an extra £42.90 a week to pay. -She should be exempt from having to pay Council tax from the date she entered the Support Group of ESA – however she needs help to make a payment arrangement towards Council tax arrears – tasked to do at next appointment, which is an extra priority expenditure.-she has a direct deduction of £6 a week towards a budgeting loan.- Please note that the food/housekeeping includes laundrette and toiletries costs.We have just assisted her to make a PIP's application today – however any decision is likely to take at least 6 months.";"2014-04-02 10:17:07";"2014-05-10 09:16:31";"1399709791"

She is on oxygen therapy to help with low oxygen levels in her blood because of the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is unable to get out of her flat independently because she can't carry the oxygen canister and she can only walk about 5-8 steps at one time. She does not like to depend on people (who are often the same age group as her) to push her in a manual wheelchair and if anyone does she sometimes cannot get access to where she wants to go because of steps, steep ramps or door frames causing access problems. This is the situation she finds herself in with the community room that is available to residents of the flats where she lives. The door frames do not easily allow a manual wheelchair access and the room is situated too far away for her to walk. Therefore she misses out on events that are held in the room and is becoming increasingly isolated and low in mood. A mobility scooter would give her the opportunity to go to the room independently and be able to drive straight into the room over the door frame. It would also give her back dignity and independence when out with her family. She would be able to visit a wider range of places such as Torquay seafront and Dartmoor. At the moment time spent with the family is only going from car to door, there is no possibility to go for a walk, a mobility scooter would give the chance to do this.

She is currently staying with a friend who cannot afford to support her financially or to feed her.  George House Trust has been assisting Lonely since 2009 with food parcels and small destitution payments and grant applications to the Terrence Higgins Trust but she is currently ineligible for a further grant from that source until 6 months has lapsed since her last application, which will not be until July 2014. THT would normally give her a grant of £150 every 6 months.  Lonely is a senior of 62 years of age.  In addition to being HIV positive (diagnosed in 2006), she has renal failure and receives dialysis treatment.  She has high blood pressure, is diabetic and suffers with arthritis. All these conditions impact adversely on her HIV and Lonely’s quality of life is very poor as a consequence.  Her arthritis causes her significant mobility problems and she needs money for public transport journeys to her appointments.  More importantly, she needs money for food as it is vital to an HIV+ person’s wellbeing that they have a properly nutritious diet.  Lonely is also in need of some new clothing – what little she has is badly worn and her impoverished standard of dress greatly lowers her self-esteem and personal dignity. This is a senior lady who suffers with very serious poor health and whose quality of life has been very low for a prolonged number of years.   A grant from the Margaret’s fund will not only help her financially but will also impact very positively on her outlook on life.   I very much hope you will be able to support this application.

I have recently started supporting Miss Kassambara as part of our housing related support service. Assitan lives with her two years old daughter; she came into the UK to join her husband. Last year the relationship broke and she and her daughter had to leave the home because of domestic violence. She was then also diagnosed with a chronic blood disease , which requires to adhere to a strict daily regime of life saving medication. For the treatment to be effective she needs to ensure a safe, stable and secure living environment, healthy and fresh food diet and avoid hardship or stress. There is stil lgreat dela of stigma and discrimination attached to the condition and she is very isolated. Despite her illness and her daughter young age she is only receiving JSA (and not ESA or Income Support because she is here ona  spouse visa). After several months in a women's refuge she is now living in a house rented froma housign association. She is making great efforts to settle into the community, make a positive contribution and move on from such painful experience. The house has been at some point infested with rats and they had to get rid of a lot of items. Assitan and her daughter are now in need of clotjes and shoes and some bedding for her daughter. Assiatan does not know anybody in Birmingham and has no support network; she can only rely on herself to provide for her and her daughter. A grant from your organisation would immensely help her in bringing some normality into their lives and making their house more a home. It would also give her the boost in confidence and self esteem she needs to start a new life.

The seating in her current wheelchairs does not provide the support she needs and both wheelchairs are uncomfortable. With new wheelchairs which meets her needs it will be much easier for her to get out and about and do more with her daughter and partner.  Everyday activities like reaching cupboards will be easier because of the elevation. She will be more comfortable and more independent. Lorna has told us that the new wheelchairs will enable her to feel more “normal” and that she would like to go back to college to study for her A levels in Law  and look forward to being able to work.Lorna has had a specialised assessment of her needs by a specialist Occupational who has recommended a new manual wheelchair and powered wheelchair to enable Lorna to be as independent as possible.

However, she is currently destitute as her application has yet to be processed.  Gorge House Trust is providing her with a £30 per month destitution payment.   Jane has a long history of very poor health. She has been treated for skin cancer, was hospitalised with TB, had an operation on both her eyes in October 2013 and is a long term sufferer with neuropathy (side effect of HIV medication) and arthritis in her legs.  Her general poor health results in recurrent chest infections and her HIV well-being is constantly under threat from her inability to eat nutritionally and to properly care for herself because of her acute poverty. Her asylum case has been on-going for several years and that together with her very poor health is causing Jane to be depressed and fearful for her future. We apply every 6 months to the Terrence Higgins Trust for a grant of £150 for her but she is currently ineligible for support from that source due to ""life-time caps"" they place on their funds.  This elderly and frail lady is in urgent need of money for food, personal toiletries and other essentials which will both sustain her and help restore some of her personal dignity.

As Lorraine lives several miles away from her mother this has increased the amount she is having to pay to run her car. Lorraine's mental health deteriorated recently when she went to hospital to see if she could be admitted to a pyschiatric ward. She is struggling to cope both emotionally and financially. Her financial situation is only short term and hopefully her Employment Support Allowance will be sorted and back being paid at the higher rate. This will maximise her income so that she can be financially independant again.";"2014-06-30 17:00:12";"2014-08-19 15:40:20";"1408459220"

Since Shelter's involvement we have liaised with Sheffield Minor Works Grant, but she was turned as the funding does not cover building of an outside toilet. Shelter has supported Mrs Ashcroft to address other charity organisation as the cost to complete the toilet is £1,521.60.

She is 45 years old and has severe OI. She also has Restrictive Breathing Disease, scoliosis and impaired hearing. She is completely reliant on her powered wheelchair.  Up until 10 years ago she was a trained secretary working at the Employment and Education Office for the Disabled in Ealing. Over the last 10 years her health has deteriorated and she now uses a ventilator 24/7 and is in constant pain.  She cannot sit up for long periods and cannot sit without support. Travelling is very difficult especially because of her ventilator.Showering sitting up is now very painful which makes it hard to shower regularly. Pat really needs a bespoke Shower/commode Trolley which will enable her to continue to independently and safely toilet and wash.  A bespoke shower trolley would make getting up in the morning much quicker and easier. It would allow Pat to more easily maintain good personal hygiene and increase her confidence. It would give her more energy to do other things each day. It would enable her to maintain some quality of life and allow her to retain as much personal dignity as possible.Pat has been assessed by her local authority Occupational Therapist and also by a specialist Occupational Therapist and they have sourced a bespoke Shower Trolley which will cost £7000. The local authority has said that they cannot fund this equipment for Pat and the Brittle Bone Society has agreed to coordinate fundraising for this piece of vital equipment.I do hope Margaret’s Fund  will be able to make a donation to allow us to order this Shower/commode  Trolley for Pat.";"2014-07-16 12:47:18";"2014-11-06 10:20:00";"1415269200"

Gofal support people who suffer from Mental Health related illnesses. We provide support and advice to access services and opportunities available to them in the area. We work in partnership with Swansea City Council Tenancy Support Scheme; our role is to offer floating support to tenants who require a higher level of support to be successful in maintaining their tenancies and issues with their mental health. Gofal have been supporting Chiedza since October 2013 on a weekly basis at her home. Support is provided around mental health issues, dealing with correspondence, ensuring that health appointments are made and attended, ensuring correct benefit entitlement, managing her tenancy as well as active listening and emotional support. Chiedza suffers with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), depression, severe anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and panic attacks. Chiedza also suffers with extreme fatigue. Chiedza is deeply affected by the SAD, to the point where it leaves her feeling suicidal. Chiedza came to the United Kingdom in 2004, after fleeing Zimbabwe due to political issues where she was receiving death threats.  Since moving to another country, Chiedza has found it extremely difficult to cope with the huge difference in climate, and over the years this has got worse. Due to Chiedza’s depression and anxiety she is often extremely anxious about everyday events, to the point where she is left unable to eat and therefore unable to take her medication. When Chiedza experiences extreme anxiety she states that she is unable to concentrate, becomes tearful, shakes uncontrollably and finds it difficult to breath. Due to this, Chiedza finds it extremely difficult to communicate with people, and she is often left unable to leave the house for weeks at a time, which is having a detrimental effect on her mental health. I feel that if Chiedza were awarded funding to enable her to purchase a light therapy lamp it may help to elevate her mood and decrease the effects of the SAD, which is having such a profound effect on her life. I hope the information I have provided clarifies the difficulties Chiedza experiences on a daily basis, and you are able to look at this application sympathetically. If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me at the office on 01792 321390.

Pamela needs curtains for her living room and her bedroom, these would provide privacy for her and help to keep the heat in.  Pamela has visits from nurses, family and friends but they don't stay long as they have nowhere to sit.

Her hospital consultant has suggested she has two months rest from treatment to enjoy her daughter and then begin a course of intensive chemotherapy to try to prolong her life, she is aware that her cancer cannot be removed. Stacey has worked as a hairdresser since leaving school, but has been unable to return to work since she left on maternity leave in June 2012. Stacey husband is a builder, but since Stacey’s illness he is only working part time as Stacey is unable to care for their daughter alone. At the time of her diagnosis, the family were saving up to move from their small terrace house into a bigger house so they have been using their savings for day to day living. They have now reached a point where they only have £900.00 left in their savings account and they feel they should save this towards Stacey’s funeral costs. Stacey suffers from incontinence so the washing machine is vital, it is still working but is temperamental not all programmes work and sometimes is fails to empty. In addition The couples bed is old and Stacey finds uncomfortable, their daughter is becoming too big for her cot and they want to buy her a new bed and they would also like to have some professional photgraphs taken as a keep sake for their daughter. Please could you consider offering some funding towards any of these items, we have also contacted the Hair and Beauty Benevolent organisation and the Percy Bilton Trust to ask for assistance.  The family have received a grant from Macmillan last year which they have used to purchase a fridge freezer and they have also been granted a holiday to Centre Parcs from the Willow Trust.

Some days she can hardly get out of bed so she is unable to consider making this journey.The housing authority have, on  my recommendation ramped the front door and are making the inside of the property more wheelchair accessible. They are providing a path from the front of the property round the back but cannot put in a new door for her as this is not in their remit and is not considered essential.It would be very beneficial for her health, both mental and physical for her to have a door from her lounge that she could at least sit at and enjoy the view and the fresh air. At the moment she can hardly see out of her window.She has had a quote from a builder ( enclosed) the work costs £1563.58 and, as it is such a large sum I am helping her write to several charities, there is no way she can afford it herself. She has an income of approx. £290 a week and expenditure of about £298 a week and she has debts of about £6000So far we have received help from  Independence at home who have pledged £350, I have also contacted the Florence nightingale aid in sickness fund, the Martineau trust and the league of the helping hand but this was not in their remit. I have also approached the newby trust, the talisman charitable trust and the JC Robinson trust.If you are able to help, if  you cannot make out the cheque to the individual, the cheque should be made out to Suffolk county council and we will administer the grant for her. Thankyou very much for your consideration.";"2014-07-29 16:26:50";"2014-08-04 16:09:28";"1407164968"

Gofal support people who suffer from Mental Health related illnesses. We provide support and advice to access services and opportunities available to them in the area. We work in partnership with Swansea City Council Tenancy Support Scheme; our role is to offer floating support to tenants who require a higher level of support to be successful in maintaining their tenancies and issues with their mental health. Gofal have been supporting Christine on a weekly basis at her home since October 2013. Christine suffers with depression, anxiety and panic attacks. Christine also has many physical health issues which affect her on a daily basis. Christine has recently been diagnosed with sciatica. Support has been provided regarding ensuring correct benefit entitlement, building self-esteem and confidence, discussing mental health issues, ensuring that health appointments are attended, dealing with correspondence and finances as well as active listening and emotional support. Until recently, Christine was living alone, and although she was finding it a struggle to keep on top of the rent payments she managed to find the outstanding £100 per month. A few weeks ago Christine’s son had no other choice but to move in with her, as he lost his job and had nowhere else to go. Christine was advised that due to her son living with her, (he is currently receiving Jobseekers Allowance (JSA)), he will be liable for a non-dependent deduction that is being taken out of Christine’s housing benefit. Christine’s son is currently only receiving around £56 per week, and is finding it very difficult to pay anything towards the rent. Christine has stated that this is affecting their relationship, and has had a serious detrimental effect on her mental health. Christine moved to her property almost two years ago, after leaving a property which she describes as not fit to live in. Christine was also burgled at her previous property, which has had a long standing effect on her mental health. Christine is currently being supported to apply for Personal Independent Payments (PIPs), due to the effect her health has on her daily living skills, which will increase her income if she is awarded it, but this will take between 6 months to a year until this is in place.  Christine is currently only receiving Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), and she finds it very difficult to manage to ensure all of her bills are paid, and states that she will buy food with whatever money is left over due to her low income. However, she is finding this increasingly difficult to manage since her son has moved in with her. Christine is reliant on her son at the moment to assist her to go out, and she has become so unwell that she is fearful of leaving the house alone, following a number of falls. Christine therefore has to catch the bus with her son, and pay for him also if he is unable to pay his fare, so this is double the price. Christine has to use public transport to get any food shopping, or to access her health appointments. I have recently accessed the food bank on Christine’s behalf, as she was struggling to afford food for the home. Christine states that she has worked all of her life, until her health conditions got so bad she was unable to, and she has found it very distressing not being able to manage her money. Christine’s current arm chair is so badly worn that the cushion at the bottom is flat. The chair does not support Christine at all, and seems to be having a detrimental effect on her physical health. Christine was recently encouraged to visit her GP due to ongoing pain, falls and her legs going numb and she was diagnosed with sciatica. Christine does not leave the house very often, so she is always in the arm chair. I feel that if Christine were able to afford a new arm chair this could alleviate some of the daily pain she is going through, therefore I am asking for £200 to enable her to purchase a new chair. I hope the information I have provided clarifies how difficult Christine’s situation is at present, and that you are able to look at this application sympathetically. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at the office on 01792 321390.

Mrs Williamson also has osteoarthritis kyphoscolisis, causing sever curvature of the spine, vascular heart disease, hiatus hernia, asthma and sciatic problems. Mr Williamson was in the army for 6 years in his youth and the charities connected to the military services have assisted Mr Williamson in the past. They have paid for him to go into respite care whilst his wife had a break and also for a period whilst their home was being renovated by the council. They have also paid for an electric rise and recline chair for Mr Williamson.  Unfortunately the original electric chair can no longer be used due to Mr Williamson’s incontinence and the local agency of SSAFA is hoping to assist Mr Williamson with a new rise and recline chair. At present Mr Williamson is using the only other easy chair in the house and this leaves Mrs Williamson sitting on the two remaining chairs which are wooden kitchen chairs.  Mrs Williamson struggles to get comfortable on these chairsIn addition Mrs Williamson is responsible for doing the couples laundry, due to her scoliosis she is unable to lift her arms above shoulder height so she cannot hang washing out, and Mr Williamson's incontinence problems means they have a lot of washing.  A tumble dryer would be a great benefit to her, please would you consider   offering Mrs Williamson some funding for an easy chair for herself and a tumble dryer as both of these items would help Mrs Williamson continue her caring role.

Grant has moderate learning difficulties and attended a special school.  He is lively and vulnerable and has no sense of danger. Mrs Butcher also attended a special school and has learning difficulties. She works part time as a cleaner at a school, she works 6.30am till 8.30 am and 4pm till 6pm and has to catch two busses for each journey.  She spends the rest of her time caring for Grant.  She struggles to access services and benefits she is entitled to and is socially isolated.  She struggles to maintain her home and support Grant and feels low and ground down by her life. They have had trouble with the neighbours because of Grants behaviour, Grant can be heavy handed and break things and lacks capacity to make the right decision on occasions. Mrs Butcher survives on a very limited income; she is sensible with her money and really tries to maintain her home.  However when I visited her it is clear she needs some help. The oven door is hanging off and only one of the gas rings works.  The washing machine has broken down and is beyond repair.   The carpet in the home although clearly relatively new was covered in bits and Mrs Butcher explained that the washing machine has flooded the kitchen and Grant had switched on the hoover to hoover the water up.  They were hoping the hoover would work again when it has dried out. The family now have a social worker supporting them, they have been granted DLA for Grant and he now has a direct payment which allows him some PA support and to access appropriate day services.  The social worker was present when I visited and rang the maintenance section of housing for Mrs Butcher to report many of the items which need resolving in the house. The tiles in the bathroom are falling off, they have no toilet seat, and the ceiling in the hall has obviously been affected by an upstairs flood and needs attention.  There home is ialso in need of decorating They  have very little furniture just a two seater sofa in the living room and their television. so I am also making a referral to St Vincents for some additional furniture for them. Grant also needs a new mattress as he decided to paint his current mattress whilst his mum was at work. Mrs Butcher has dedicated her life to raising her son, but is really struggling to keep positive and carry on her caring role.  She has no friends or support and feels intimadated by her neighbours who are raising complaints about her son.  any help you could offer would improve life for Mrs Butcher.

Shannon does not eat as she has a bad relationship with food and her body.  Shannon has lost a lot of weight dealing with her health issues and this has resulted in her not having any suitable winter clothing.  Shannon claims ESA benefit but with her expenditure this does not leave enough for clothing.  Shannon needs underwear, jeans, tops and a coat for the winter.

Mrs Kaur has to physically attend to both sons in order to assist them with all aspects of daily living.The family is on a low income based on welfare benefits alone. She spends a lot more due to her disabilities as well as that of her sons. For example, Mrs Kaur uses taxis to get to places because she as well as the disabled sons have difficulties using public means.

She and the family receive ongoing support in order for her to be cope with the difficult situation. The family live in poor housing conditions and are being assisted to get suitable accommodation. I have personally assisted Mrs Kaur to make claims for benefits she was entitled to but was not aware of. The family lacks many basic essentials which makes Mrs Kaur's caring role difficult and also puts them at risk of injury. We are making a concerted effort to help Mrs Kaur to obtain what is required in order to re-build and improve her life. A member of staff made a home visit and established that the family have poor and inappropriate sleeping arrangements which in itself has an adverse effect on their health and wellbeing. Mrs Kaur for example sleeps with her younger son Aaron. She has problems with sleep and sharing a bed with the son does not help her situation.Mr Kaur needs financial assistance to obtain a bed for herself (leaving the one she has for the son). Sleeping separately will be more appropriate, comfortable and reduce some of the stress she faces. A new bed for Mrs Kaur will ensure a degree of privacy as well as allow for better rest. This in general will improve her and the family's health and wellbeing.We made a request to the Buttle Trust for a bunk bed for both sons. This was unsuccessful.Another request of £400 was made to the Carers trust for bedroom furniture. She has been awarded £250.Applied to the HAFK foundation for  bedding items.  £100 has been awarded on condition that she/we raise the outstanding balance.I kindly request you to financially assist this woman in severe need and her family. She feels overwhelmed and the lack of proper sleeping facilities worsens  her and the boys health conditions. The family is unable to afford these items if not supported financially. Any assistance is highly appreciated and will make a positive difference in Mrs Kaur's life as well as that of the entire family. ";"2014-10-28 22:56:51";"2015-01-08 17:10:29";NULL

Peace came in this country in 2004 from Burundi. She came with an agent, who was a man from Burundi, he promised Peace that he will bring her to London, and take care of her and find her work.He took her to his friend's house that was a lady and told her that, the lady will be the one to give her work and look after her, in Acton. she stayed there helping to look after her children and to do housework. But the lady said that, she can't pay her as she was feeding her and also accommodating her.After two months, Peace felt unwell, she started coughing, and felt weak day by day. The lady though that Peace was just making it up, that she was lazy, she didn't want to do the housework which wasn't true.One day, when she took the kids to MacDonald's she met a lady from Burundi of which they started chatting and Peace explained to her, her problems. The lady was sympathetic and gave Peace her number and asked to her so that they can meet again.Peace met the lady again at MacDonald's every time she took the kids at school. Peace felt relieved to find a friend who could listen to her problems that, she was going through. In two weeks' time, in the same year, Peace moved out of the lady's house and went to stay with her new friend in Edmonton. Her new friend became aware of Peace symptoms, and decided to help her get tested of HIV and all other sexual diseases.Her friend made enquiries of where to take her for sexual health tests and she was told to go to IVO in Tottenham which was a voluntary organization testing people with sexual diseases, she was told that, she is HIV positive. She was then advised to go to St. Mary's hospital to start treatment. She was put on treatment right away as she was getting weaker. The treatment gave her side effects of feeling weak and anaemic.The IVO organization helped her to get a solicitor to help with her immigration issues to make an application to the Home Office to stay in this country.

She was initially granted a one year visa but the wages she had been promised were not paid, she was overworked and not given any weekend offs. She managed to make some friends who persuaded her to try and get a better job. She eventually ran away from her employer and got some work as a live in carer where she managed to make and save some money which she would eventually use to make an application for immigration. She ended up paying for a scam and all her money was taken and nothing was done for her. Amina did not consider returning to her country because when she left Botswana she had been sexually abused by her step father and her mother would not believe her. She instead sent her off with the diplomat's family so she could earn some money and send some back to her mother. Amina is still quite traumatised by this experience and she feels that she can never be able to return to face her step father apart from the fact that she would struggle to get HIV treatment.Amina was helped to find another job and has been working with this company for the last 3 years as a catering assistant. However, she then started a relationship and had her daughter in December 2013 but was also diagnosed HIV+. She has since then  found the cost of living very high as she now has to take child care into account  which eats into her wages, general living expenses including food, milk, clothes and  bills have left her struggling and she sometimes does not have enough to buy baby's milk and nappies. She has no recourse to public funds as her immigration application is yet to be submitted which is another expense that will mean she will not have enough for all her expenses and has some difficult choices to make.  Amina could use some extra cash to help stock up on baby milk, food as baby is now on solids now, nappies as she is as yet not toilet trained and winter clothes. We are asking for a contribution of £100 as we also approach other charities for her travel and child care costs which are on-going.  Ms Adams will be able to access some statutory funding once she has submitted her application but needs help in the meantime as she completes this process.";"2014-11-06 16:23:21";"2015-01-08 13:49:16";"1420724956"

Florence belongs to the Tutsi ethnic group. Her husband was also a Tutsi and they had four children. When the genocide started they contemplated leaving Rwanda as most of the inhabitants of their village did but since all they had was their hut, small piece of land and four young children to feed, they decided to stay. Her husband was killed in August 1993. One day she got back from work and found out that her children have disappeared. She still doesn’t know if they were abducted or fled due to an attack on the village. By that time the village was almost empty and up to this day she still doesn’t know if they survived the genocide. As the situation worsened in Rwanda, she decided to escape to Uganda and on her way to the border she was raped by three men. In Uganda she ended up living on the streets.  Eventually she managed to get a job as a maid. She worked long hours every day of the week and never received any money for it. When the family she worked for moved to London, Florence came with them. In London her working conditions worsened. She was living as a virtual house slave and was not allowed any human contact outside the house.  Eventually the family asked her to leave the house and she found shelter at a Church in Holloway Road. One of the members of the church offered her accommodation. She lived with him until 2011. In 2008 she started feeling unwell and was taken to hospital. She was initially diagnosed with diabe-tes and subsequently she was diagnosed HIV positive. She believes she contracted the virus from the rape episode near the border to Uganda. From 2011 until 2014 she lived in an accommodation provided by the National Asylum Support Ser-vice. Florence was granted a leave to remain in the UK and most recently placed in an accommoda-tion provided by Camden Council. She has tried for years to find her children. She has never returned to Rwanda. Florence has been experiencing other health issues such as depression, hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, high cholesterol, peripheral neuropathy, heart burn, low vitamin D and osteo-arthritis of the knees. Need Florence lives on a very limited budget and is in need of financial assistant for some basic appliances.Any assistance given to Florence will be highly appreciated by her.";"2014-11-13 16:05:06";"2015-01-08 16:57:43";"1420736263"

The windows in Mrs Davidson’s living room and bedroom really need to be replaced. There is no effective insulation, cold and water are accessing the property and their condition is steadily deteriorating, the sills are flaking and coming away. When it rains there is always water ingress which Gaby has then to wipe down with a towel.Gaby is 60 and divorced. She suffers from palpitations which have meant she has had to have 2 cardial ablations.  I can provide a medical report confirming this if required. The second operation was not so successful with a greater recovery time and when the palpations occur during the night she is left exhausted during the day due to lack of sleep. Gaby also has asthma and arthritis and is awaiting a knee replacement. She has been signed off work sick from 8th September after the second cardial ablation and is due to return on 20 November for 2 days to see if she is then able to continue working. If not, her income will be greatly affected. Mrs Davidson has worked a mental health support worker for the NHS for 7 years in Torphins assisting individuals with Alzheimers and mental health problems. She also undertakes relief home care for the Social Work Department in Banchory for 8 years. However she does not receive a guaranteed form of income from this second post, it is as and when needed, some months she is not required at all and if she is off sick she receives no income from this job. Gaby previously worked for 13 years as a carer for Bellfield Church of Scotland, Banchory.Gaby has little savings, no excess income a month and is not able to afford to get this much needed work carried out, getting these windows replaced would be beneficial to her general well being and notably her health as she is extremely stressed about the current situation. It would ensure her living room and bedroom are warm, secure and protected from the elements. In addition Gaby’s boiler is over 13 years old and does not meet current standards. It is extremely costly to heat her house, we have referred her to The Energy Savings Trust but the likelihood is that she will have future costs towards a boiler replacement. She asked us to try and assist with the windows first as this is her main priority. Previous house repairs, general livings costs and the fact her monthly income does not cover her bills has led to her being over 18 thousand pounds in debt.We have received a quote from a local contractor which estimates that the total cost will be £1899.60 and this is the target currently sought. I am very much hoping that you will be able to consider this application for financial assistance and would be grateful for any help you could offer. We are also applying to The Heinz, Anna and Carol Kroch Foundation, The Perry Fund, The Talisman Charitable Trust and Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland. I appreciate your consideration of this application and if you do require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. ";"2014-11-19 11:13:52";"2014-11-28 15:17:57";"1417187877"

She has been left Aphasic with minimal speech and she also has a significant Hemiparesis.As a single mother of a small child, Shirley struggled with the limitations of her disability and the demands of having a small child, and relied on her family for support. As she has aged, other associated problems have occurred and this has resulted in her having to downsize her home to avoid stairs and a bath. She now lives alone, in a single person property owned by the local authority. Her new property is located in a busy area and parking near her property is quite an ordeal, leaving Miss Simpson vulnerable and at risk when trying to access her car and home. She currently mobilises with a quad stick but only walks short distances to and from her car or venue. The new property is located on a busy street with multiple on street parking, and Miss Simpson often finds herself going to her friend’s house as she is unable to park a manageable walking distance from her home. There are already two disabled person’s street parking areas nearby but they are used consistently by the residents that they were originally installed for. Miss Simpson can be quite unsteady when mobilising and any adverse weather causes her to remain indoors rather than negotiate the route to her car. Her new property has ample room at the front of the property to create off road parking which will greatly improve her quality of life, independence and safety. The full cost of the work is £2838.00 and we have raised £1150 to date.

Miss Olwa started anti HIV combination therapy medications straight away as her immune system was very low and she was at risk of developing an AIDS type illness.Lillian has gone through many different HIV treatments which have had quite a lot of side effects, some of them irreversible. She suffers from peripheral neuropathy, causing her a lot of pain in the lower limbs and hands. She also has insomnia as a result of the HIV treatment.Furthermore, Miss Olwa suffers from fibroids in the uterus. She has undergone three surgical operations to remove them; as a result she has lost both of the fallopian tubes and she has additionally undergone surgery to remove her uterus.  All of these problems have caused a lot of distress due to the fact that fibroid sufferers have long, heavy and very painful periods, for what she has to take strong pain killers. As a result of the heavy periods she is constantly anaemic and therefore very tired and with low energy levels.The diagnosis of HIV infection plus the removal of the fallopian tubes and now the uterus is causing a great psychological impact to Lillian; she has no children and will not be able to have them. Despite her health issues, she has been volunteering at the Terrence Higgins Trust HIV charity offering peer support to other people with HIV.  She also studies and hopes to become a certified counsellor in order that she might achieve a paid position as a therapist.  Miss Olwa is in need of the fee which is £1000 to apply for discretionary leave to remain here in the UK; Miss Olwa is very keen to help herself as she is seeking advice to take a loan from a local credit union which can possibly offer her a low interest loan to contribute to the full amount.I would like to ask you for a contribution of what you are able to afford so we can try and obtain the full amount of £1000 including the loan, for the near future. Any contribution will help and I will confirm outcome once we hopefully obtain the full amount.Other charities I have applied to are: Margaret’s fund, Heinz, Anna and Carol Kroch Foundation, Fund for Human need and Margaret’s fund.

She suffers from asthma which is severe with frequent attacks that on bad days requires hospital treatment. Her condition can be triggered of by a number of factors including smoke, dust, air pollution and various indoor irritants. She is prone to infections especially colds and flu.Elizabeth provides substantial care to her brother in law Mr David Kirunda who suffers from parkinson disease. He lives a few doors away in the same street.Elizabeth spends most of her time looking after the severely disabled David who is wheelchair bound and requires help with all aspects of daily living. Elizabeth cooks and feeds him, helps with dressing, toileting and bathing. She has to provide medication and keep watch over him as he is very prone to falls. The effort of looking after David is physically straining and emotionally stressful to Elizabeth. She has developed chronic lower back pain due to the constant lifting and physical support that she provides in order for David to transfer or walk around.We have been working with Elizabeth for four years now. She is in poverty and experiences financial difficulties. Part of her problem is that she has to take care of two households, her's and that of the person she carers for.  She is on a very low income and largely dependent on welfare benefits. We have provided food and clothing items to her on various occassions.Elizabeth would like to have a new bed and beddings.  She spends a number of nights watching over David which over the years has meant that she neglected her own sleeping arrangements. Her bed is small and broken. It is not only uncomfortable but does also contribute to the pains in her lower back.Having a new larger bed will improve her well being.  She will have better sleep and rest comfortably.  Elizabeth is unable to obtain this essential item unless financially assisted. We kindly request you to assist this lady who is faced with difficult circumstances. Any help provided is highly appreciated. ";"2014-12-11 22:50:23";"2015-01-15 19:19:28";"1421349568"

Miss Hughes is in tremendous pain every day and as such is on substantial medication. She is on prescribed ketamine patches amongst an array of other medications. She is often bed bound, unable to get up due to pain. Her quality of life is severely restricted and she is now unable to walk. Her body is gradually deteriorating and she is now reliant upon an electric wheelchair within the home, if she is well enough to get up. She can transfer from chair to bed but is unable to walk or weight bear. She can spend a lot of the day asleep or heavily medicated so  has limited awareness and memory of what is happening around her. She has carers twice per day to assist with personal care. Her daughter is her full time carer during the day and night within the home,  attending to her needs. Miss Hughes’s co-ordination and muscle control  is heavily affected by her medication so she is prone to dropping things, knocking over drinks and dishes, spilling drinks and food and is now having to use pads as her continence has been affected. This results in excessive amounts of washing, with her bed sheets needing to be changed every day and sometimes, two or three times a day. She regularly has to change clothing during the day from spilling food, drinks, soiling,etc. Her daughter is washing the clothing and sheets but is finding it difficult to get them dry. She is drying some clothing on radiators but it is not possible to do this with sheets and large bedding items and the house is starting to smell damp with wet washing  hanging around. Washing could be hung outside during the summer to dry but now this is not possible due to the weather, things are becoming more difficult. The nearest launderette is a bus journey away but Miss Hughes cannot be left alone at home due to her fragile health and need of supervision. Her daughter has to stay with her mum at all times so she is unable to leave her to attend the launderette. She only has 3 hours per fortnight respite time when other carers come in, but it would be unfair to expect her to spend this time at the launderette. Mrs Hughes' daughter is also awaiting an urgent operation and will be in recovery for several weeks afterwards during which time she will be restricted on physical activity also and likely to be creating extra washing and in need of care herself during this time.Miss Hughes is aware that her condition is untreatable. Surgeons are unwilling to operate as they predict only a 3% chance of survival and Miss Hughes is aware the medication she is taking is affecting her long term health also. Her relationship with her daughter has been affected due to their changing roles and anything that may help reduce the pressure on her daughter at this time would be greatly appreciated.

She requires a lot of assistance with most tasks including help with bodily functions. She is prone to falls and in the past 3 months she has fallen over 2 times leading to body injuries and hospital treatment. She needs to be watched over most of the time. When Margaret fell in the home garden for example, she was unable to get up or call for assistance. It was a neighbour who came to her rescue several minutes after the fall. Her memory is poor and cannot fully use her hands to hold things like cups due to the carpal tunnel syndrome.Margaret lives with her daughter and two grandchildren aged 14 and 18. These provide care especially when her daughter is away doing part time work. The family is on a very low income and struggling financially. They live in inadequate housing. Margaret has to share a room and bed with her 14 year old granddaughter something which she feels uncomfortable with.Additionally, the bedroom is upstairs while she spends most of the time in the seating room downstairs. At times, she is unable to manage the stairs on her own in order to go for a rest as this can also lead to falls. It is for this reason that Margaret would like a sofa bed in the seating room so that when she needs to have a rest or sleep especially during the day she does not have to struggle with the stairs.Having the requested item will ensure that Margaret rests comfortably and reduce the risk of falls she faces when using stairs when unaccompanied. This will improve her general health well being.We have been involved with Margaret and her family for a number of years now. She is a lovely and a proud lady but at times finds it difficult to ask for help where needed. I kindly request you to assist this elderly lady as she is unable to obtain the sofa if not financially assisted. Any help provided is highly appreciated.";"2014-12-27 15:24:22";"2015-01-08 13:56:28";"1420725388"

O. Box 135BuntingfordSG11 2XJ31st December 2014	Dear Sir/Madam,Re: Request for financial assistance for Ms Meliha Kemalova My name is Shamsa Mughal and I am currently supporting Ms Meliha Kemalova under the British Red Cross Supporting People Circles Project, which supports Gypsies and Traveler’s. I am writing with reference to her application for a grant from your organization as Ms. Kemalova is suffering with depression.I respectfully request that you consider awarding Ms Kemalova a grant. Ms Kemalova and her young child (2 year old boy) is settling into the community after an unsettled way of life.  Ms Kemalova is originally from the travelling community in Bulgaria, she is working as a cleaner, cleaning people’s houses, but this is impacting on her health as it is not a regular income and she does not have access to benefits. Ms Kemalova has always been able to provide for her family but due to her limited finances as her husband has lost his job this year’s events have been traumatic and left her in deep depression and unable to work. Ms Kemalova has no savings and she is currently struggling in supporting the family financially and ensuring a safe, stable and secure environment for her and her family.Ms Kemalova is struggling to keep the place habitable and acquire the basic needs to maintain a healthy diet for her and her child.I therefore would like to kindly request that you consider awarding Ms Kemalova a grant of £200 to help her raise the money to afford the essential items above.I hope all of the above is satisfactory, however, should you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me.Yours sincerely Shamsa MughalSupport WorkerBritish Red Cross, Supporting People, CirclesMobile: 07841 865 912Office: 0121 766 5444Email: SMughal@redcross.org.uk";"2014-12-31 10:24:01";"2015-01-08 13:54:27";"1420725267"

She manages to walk very short distances with extreme difficulty and spends a lot of money on taxis.  She gets very depressed with her situation and the pain she is in and spends most of her time isolated.  She spends around 49.00 weekly on cigarettes as she finds it very difficult to give them up.  I feel that Catherine would benefit greatly by having the means to purchase a mobility scooter to enable her to have more freedom and be less isolated.  Hopefully this would also help with her depression as at present she spends a lot of time on her own.  ";"2014-12-31 12:41:15";"2015-01-21 14:39:09";"1421851149"

Thankfully they are now living in shared house, and will hopefully be moving in a new (unfurnished) property of their own in the next couple of weeks.

She has previously worked a Nurse and would like to have an office/admin role in the future but is too ill to work at the moment.  She was on JSA but this was stopped as he was unable to make the JobCentre appointments due to being in hospital or too ill to attend. Therefore I have made an application for ESA but this may take up to 28 days to process. My client is taking positive steps to regain control and have some standard of living. Through a council run scheme she has been able to put down a deposit for a flat and will hopefully in the property in a couple of weeks’ time.  She is also hoping to start working as soon as she is physically able to. Due to her situation my client’s expenditure is notably higher than her income. As a result the family have debts to pay but do not know the exact amount but she believes it to be around £1000 as they have been living off credit cards and store card to pay for essential items . Therefore we are applying for the grant to help with her general living expenses. Any help is greatly appreciated.";"2015-01-07 11:20:01";"2015-03-05 15:20:07";"1425568807"

Her clothes, bedding and towels are in bags on her bedroom floor, she can't find anything and this situation is not helping her mental health status. There is no floor covering in the bathroom and therefore the bathroom is very cold.

Louise's condition is severe and her mobility is extremely poor. She cannot go anywhere without assistance and her body shakes uncontrollably. She gets some mild relief from smoking cannabis but we are trying to look for alternative therapies for her so that she can stop the cannabis use. Unfortunately there isn't much available to her in Dumfries. There is however a centre in Maryhill in Glasgow called the RISE Centre that would provide support, counselling and alternative treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy which she might benefit from. Also the staff at this centre are trained in Louise's condition and she would also meet a lot of people going through the same as her. Access to this place is free however travel is not provided. Louise cant travel on a bus and train would be difficult for her. The only real way would be by car which would obviously prove costly. I really feel that Louise would benefit greatly from attending this centre and it would improve her quality of life no end. If you could consider this application to allow Louise to travel and benefit from the help they could provide for her I know that she would be eternally grateful.

She needs a memory foam topper to go on top of her mattress for comfort. She does not have a TV in her bedroom only one in the lounge. She lives alone, relying on friends and family for support; plus the Macmillan nurses. She needs to buy her grave plot and would also like to have a respite break.

She has no knowledge of the area she has been living in for 8 months as she cannot go out. A mobility scooter would give her some independance whilst living with her daughter. We are an organisation within 10 minutes walking distance from Ellie with many community projects including over 50s social groups who we encourage to run themselves to a certain extent.We are working towards Ellie being able to attend the centre and take advantage of what is right on her doorstep !

She has been living with disability since an accident at work 15 years ago, but since giving birth in October 2014 to her daughter Chloe, she has had extremely poor mobility. During her pregnancy her pelvis became misaligned – a very painful condition known as sympysis pubis dysfunction or pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Normally this condition improves following the birth of a baby. However in a small number of cases it doesn’t clear up spontaneously. Unfortunately this is the case with Louise. She is currently undergoing medical assessment and is waiting for x-ray and MRI scan to help determine a course of treatment. Meanwhile she is unable to walk, climb the stairs or stand without mobility aids. She is in receipt of direct payments and is employing a personal assistant for 17.5 hours a week, but obviously caring for her two children, one aged 4 yrs, the other, 4 months is extremely challenging in her condition. Removing the difficulty of negotiating the stairs will benefit Louise’s health physically and mentally and to be able to get up and down safely with her baby will improve the quality of day to day life for the whole family. In her words she is “desperate to get her life back”Unfortunately due to cut backs in expenditure the local authority are unable to fund a stairlift. The cost of installation is £850 for a re-conditioned stairlift. £200 of which the client has agreed to contribute herself. £225 has been pledged by local charities. But there is still a shortfall of £425. . We sincerely hope that Margaret’s fund will be able to make up this deficit.  We came across Margaret’s online and Louise’s circumstances seemed to fit your criteria for grants, hence this application.

Gofal support people who suffer from Mental Health related illnesses. We provide support and advice to access services and opportunities available to them in the area. We work in partnership with Swansea City Council Tenancy Support Scheme; our role is to offer floating support to tenants who require a higher level of support to be successful in maintaining their tenancies and issues with their mental health. Gofal have been supporting Mrs Ncube since October 2013, on a weekly basis at her home. Support has been provided with: - ensuring correct benefit entitlement, tenancy and personal safety issues, liaising with local MP’s, police and Victim Support in relation to anti-social behaviour, active listening and emotional support, as well as promoting social integration. Mrs Ncube has lived at her address since she came to Swansea seeking asylum just over ten years ago, and has been very happy at her address until recently. Mrs Ncube has been the victim of anti-social behaviour from her neighbours for the last year. She has suffered from racial abuse, as well as other forms of harassment from the neighbour and their children, who will taunt Mrs Ncube on a daily basis, leaving her not wanting to leave her home. The children have been walking through her both back and front gardens using it as a through way, as well as looking through her windows including her bathroom window when her son was in there, despite her asking them not to and also asking their parents to tell them not to. The parents of the children have reacted to this by also taunting Mrs Ncube. There was previously a fence at the front garden between Mrs Ncube’s garden and her neighbours, but this was removed while Mrs Ncube was out one day. Mrs Ncube has managed to replace and secure this fence with her own money as it was only a small fence, but she is in desperate need of fencing for her back garden. Mrs Ncube’s back garden has no boundary fencing what so ever, and as well as the children going into her garden, there are also dogs who use her garden as a toilet on a daily basis. Mrs Ncube is terrified of dogs, which makes this situation even more unbearable for her. We have liaised with the local MP regarding this situation, who contacted the police. The police called to the neighbour’s home, but it has not eased the situation enormously. We have also liaised with Victim Support, who will provide ongoing support to Mrs Ncube, and also the Community Housing Officer, who has been very supportive but has stated that there are no funds available to them to provide fencing. Due to the fact that the neighbour is privately renting, they are also not breaching any tenancy conditions with the Council, so there is little that the Community Housing Officer is able to do in this respect.  Mrs Ncube has been quoted a price of £380.00 for the fence in the back garden, to be purchased and fitted. After pricing around, we have been informed that this is a very reasonable price for the work which needs to be completed. Having this fencing would make such a huge difference to Mrs Ncube’s mental health and wellbeing, and she would feel safer in her own home. We are very limited with charities who we are able to apply for this type of funding, and I have previously supported Mrs Ncube to make an application to the Discretionary assistance Fund (DAF), but this has recently been turned down. This situation is currently causing Mrs Ncube a great deal of stress and anxiety and is having a very negative impact on her mental health and wellbeing. I hope the information I have provided clarifies how this current situation is affecting Mrs Ncube, and how it would improve her circumstances significantly. I hope you are able to look at this request sympathetically and get back to us as soon as you can. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at the office on 01792 321390.

Following a chat about the AA criteria, we agreed that it would not be appropriate to apply; Ms Carroll can mange all her own personal care currently, albeit slowly, her main problem is lack of mobility due to her Arthritis. Ms Carroll's niece was at her flat when I visited and during our chat it transpired that there are a few items that Ms Carroll needs to replace but has no savings to do so; the main item is a new mattress. Ms Carroll's niece showed me a picture on her phone of her current mattress and I have to say it really did look like it had seen better days, it looked very thin and tired. Ms Carroll's niece is concerned about her sleeping on this as it is not going to be assisting her Arthritis. I suggested we should apply for an Orthopaedic mattress to give her the most support possible and if we can get a good quality one for her it should last her for many years to come.

She has two children aged 4 and 5 years old and lives with her grandmother. She has been in the UK for the last 13 years and continues to appeal for leave to remain in the UK. She is a member of the Cara Trust which is an organisation that supports people who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. Ms Cuthbert is HIV positive having been diagnosed in 2007, but her children are not.  In addition she suffers from Diabetes.Ms Cuthbert’s situation is that as one with no recourse to public funds has no entitlement to benefits in her own right nor can she work. Her children’s child benefit and tax credits which comes to approximately £134 a week though being claimed via her grandmother and to the best of my knowledge this is the only income available to the family which she has no control over and is only given transport so she can take children to school the other expenditure on them is an estimate because she is more or less dependent on the grandmother.  She comes to the Cara food bank on a weekly basis which in itself is an indicator of how difficult her situation must be. I believe that Ms Cuthbert and her children are living on the poverty line and do need some help buying clothes and beddings which would be difficult to obtain any other way.  We would appreciate of at least £100 or more towards Ms Cuthbert we are also approaching and approach other funders such as the Talisman Trust for a contribution towards Ms Cuthbert’s needs.

Jimenoch is five years old and has a severe form of autism and a learning disability, with associated sleep depravation and hyperactivity. He has very limited speech and attends a special school. He has no awareness of danger and is constantly 'on the go'. He is receiving behavioural support from a local specialist. His family have a good size garden for him to play in, however he cannot currently play in the garden safely as he is able to scale the three-foot boundary wire fence into the next door neighbours garden. He will try and attempt to climb over the fence even when being supervised, and he is a very strong little boy. He is fascinated by the neighbours rabbit and dog and will climb over the fence at every possible opportunity to reach them.  This presents a high risk to all parties as his behaviour towards animals can be aggressive and inappropriate. He is at high risk of cutting himself on the wire fence and has torn clothes on many occasions. His parents are also worried that he is able to abscond on to the main road from the neighbours garden, which is not secure.  In order for Jimenoch to access the garden safely, it is considered that a higher and more robust fencing provision is required. The family are also in need to replace their existing side gate because it is not robust or secure enough to keep him safe in the garden and prevent access to the road.  If you are able to assist in any way it would be very much appreciated by all  those involved with Jimenoch";"2015-04-17 14:21:31";"2015-04-23 12:18:07";"1429787887"

Deborah is moving to a one bedroom property which will means that she is no longer charged the bedroom tax however; she needs to make regular payments against her arrears for her old property.  She also has arrears with her council tax which accrued due to approved deduction from benenfit not being taken, despite Deborah receiving a letter advising her that they were being taken.  Deborah has no money for removals and I have approached my Manager to see if there is anyway we can fund Deborah's removals as a gesture of goodwill due to her extenuating circumstances.  Deborah needs flooring in her new property as this will make the surface even for her to walk on and will avoid any unneccessary trips and falls.  It will also assist Deborah to maintain heat within the property.  This is an extremely distressing time for Deborah as she is devastated to be leaving her family home.  Her situation is further compounded by her poor financail situation.  If she stays in her current property she will accrue further arrears, but she cannot afford to pay for removals and flooring at the new property.

We are a team of Carer Support Advisers based in all 68 GP practices in Worcestershire where we support the county’s informal unpaid carers – of which there are approximately 63,000.Lisa, a lovely lady and a highly valued member of the team, specialises in providing support to families who are caring for people with challenging health problems such as dementia and mental health issues. Carers greatly benefit from this crucial support so that they can sustain their family caring roles.Lisa really enjoys the satisfaction of helping to support such carers during their most vulnerable times and has had many positive outcomes through her interventions. She is a single parent looking after her 12 year old daughter and has been totally self-sufficient after her husband of 12 years walked out on the family some three years ago and contributes little financially. She has had to learn new skills and independence in order to keep a calm and secure environment for her daughter who was particularly affected by the divorce. Lisa has had a very difficult year after having reached a decision to end an engagement seven weeks before her wedding due to her partner’s complex mental health issues which were unresolvable.  The fall out of the relationship ending caused Lisa to suffer a breakdown and whilst she is slowly recovering she still suffers from anxiety and depression.  To aid her recovery, a two month sabbatical from work has been agreed for Lisa to visit Italy.  Solo travel is something that Lisa has always aspired to do and she feels that the experience will help her to rebuild her confidence, and expand her horizons.  She will be travelling on her own for three weeks in July and her daughter will be joining her in the school holidays. Lisa has managed to save up some funds to pay for flights and part of her accommodation costs, but she will have a tight budget and be without pay for 4 weeks.  With this in mind I would like to request financial assistance in the sum of £300 to help meet her accommodation costs.Hopefully Lisa can come back to work refreshed, positive and in a much better place emotionally.Thank you for taking the time to consider this applicationKind Regards Mary SlaterGP Carer Support Service Manager";"2015-06-09 14:05:30";"2015-06-23 13:35:38";"1435062938"

She was living in care since she was 8 years old. Recently she has moved to live independently. She needs help with furnishing her flat. At present I am supporting Anne-Marrie to get the necessary help. Anne-Marrie has received some help from Bromley Welfare Fund but they refused to help her with carpeting the flat . Anne-Marrie needs carpet in her flat and would like financial support to help her to pay towards carpet for her front room, hall and bedroom. There is no proper flooring thus the living conditions are not acceptable as she is a vulnerable young person.  She would like to apply for approximately £500 as an estimate of about £700 was previously given to her. It will be very much appreciated if you taken into account the factors mentioned above when making a decision.Kind RegardsDesislava Kirilova (Daisy)FLOATING SUPPORT WORKER ";"2015-05-06 17:24:28";"2015-06-08 16:05:59";"1433775959"

As a result of her severe medical conditions, she experiences sharp chronic pain in the lower part of the abdomen. She is weak, constantly fatigued and tires easily with any activity of physical exertion. Her mobility is restricted as she cannot stand or walk for long. She also finds it difficult to sit for extended periods of time and as a result she spends most of her time sleeping on the bed.We have assisted her to make a claim for ESA. We are assiting in applying for PIP.In the mean time, Mrs Kakaire is faced with financial hardship which also negatively impacts on her ill health.She would like to obtain a new sofa bed because the seats she has are old and no longer suitable for her physical condition. She struggles to get on/off the seats and requires physical help from someone else to do so. This even with support is done in pain and discomfort.A new sofa bed will enable this isolated lady to have a degree of indepedence and comfort. It will be easier for her to sit or sleep on the sofa bed without requiring help from others.

Mrs Cole is a single parent and cares for her physically disabled daughter Nicola who has cerebral palsy and learning difficulties. Mrs Cole suffers from anxiety and depression and she has become very isolated in her flat owing to the number of years she has been caring for her grown up daughter single handed. She also now has generalized arthritis due to the amount of lifting and handling of her daughter which she has she has done over the years.Nicola has cerebral palsy of a spastic nature which affects one side of her body [she has a hemiplegia]. This affects her ability to mobilize both indoors and outdoors. In many ways this family have slipped through the net since Nicola left school many years ago and she does not have access to a number of items of equipment such as a suitable wheelchair for indoor use. Hence Nicola has been crawling on the floor to get from A to B in their ground floor flat for many years and she has to rely on her mother to assist her with many activities of daily living. I am now trying to improve Nicola and her mum’s situation by trying to organize various items of equipment that will enhance Nicola's independence and take some of the pressure off her mum.Mum and Nicola are both reliant on benefits for their income and mum has had a recent benefits check to ensure she is in receipt of all that she is entitled to.However mum is currently struggling to buy a few essential household itemsOwing to the high costs associated with Nicola’s disability as outlined in the following examples, Mrs Cole is finding it difficult to afford the costs of these items. Nicola is at home all day and requires to have the heating switched on for most of the time as she becomes very stiff if she gets cold making it difficult for her to mobilize. She is reliant on using taxis to get out and about as she has to go out in her wheelchair at all times which her mum has to push. As Mrs Cole is getting older she is finding the latter increasingly difficult to carry out, hence her reliance on taxis to take Nicola out of the flat. Owing to the way in which Nicola mobilizes [she has to crawl everywhere] her clothes and shoes quickly become worn out and these are constantly in need of replacement. Nicola has a dog which we are currently endeavouring to train up to be an assistance dog for her to help her around the house and the latter means family have to spend money on food and vet charges. As Nicola has learning difficulties she often spills food that she is eating down her front which means that her clothes constantly need to be washed and dried. Her trousers are also usually marked and scuffed by the end of each day owing to the fact she has to crawl on the floor to get around again precipitating frequent washing for her mother.Hence this application is to request consideration for a grant to go towards the cost of a new washing machine. For your information an application to the Local Assistance Scheme made earlier this month for this item has been turned down and hence we are unable to access statutory funding for this particular item.In the event that we are successful could I ask that you make any cheque payable to a local disability group based in Solihull called “Solihull Dial” [http://www.dialsolihull.org.uk/] who will in turn accept the cheque and make it payable to family? Any receipt will be collected and sent to your organization when I am in possession of these. Could I ask that the cheque be sent to my address [the Scope Helpline address] so that I can then liaise directly with Solihull Dial about this?I hope that the above represents sufficient information for your purposes. Please do get in touch if you need to discuss any aspect of this letter. ";"2015-05-11 13:34:31";"2015-06-08 16:00:23";"1433775623"

The most recent work has been to assist and support the family to move at short notice, as a result of the ongoing domestic abuse subjected by Miss Peters’ ex-partner.  As a result of the urgent move, and many other expenses, the family are unable to afford caprets for their new home, and would therefore benefit from some assistance.Miss Peters also suffered a second heart attack (April 2014), which has been a huge set back for her health & mental well-being.  Miss Peters also suffers with depression and anxiety, and has had suicidal thoughts, and has been extremely tearful.Ideally, we are keen as a service, to support this family to have a fresh start, and the strength to move on from the unfortunate circumstances they found themselves in.  I will continue to support this family and assist them with their ongoing issues.Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information.

Mrs Jeffries has had numerous hospital admissions recently and she states that her old bed is extremely uncomfortable and worn out, it belonged to her mother.  Mrs Jeffries is also becoming increasingly anxious that she will die in the bed that her mother died in which is an awful thought.

Karen has MS, which is slowly progressing since her diagnosis 7 years ago.  Karen relied on the support of her husband until earlier this year when he left.  She now needs the support from her mum, Eli Pickering.  Eli who is Norwegian, was aiming to go to Norway this August for her annual visit. She tries to go each year since becoming a widow, at the same time as Karen was diagnosed with MS. Eli came in to see me, as she was concerned that this year she may not be able to go, as she needs to be here for Karen.  She was extremely distressed, as she also needs the support from her sisters, aunts and uncles in Norway.  Karen also misses the family members, as they do her, she keeps in contact by text message, however, she said to me she longs for a big overdue Norwegian family cuddle.  I spoke to the local carer's centre, (Dochas Centre) and managed to secure funding of £500 for Eli to make the trip, however, she is now reluctant to go without Karen.  As Karen is living with an unpredictable, progressive and debilitating condition, she does not know how she will be in future years.  She would be able to travel this year with her mum, but this may be the last year she is able to do so.  I am applying for this fund to make this dream trip to Norway possible for both Karen and Eli.   The fund would cover travel, spending money, kennel costs and car hire (expensive in Norway -£500, but essential in the remote part of Norway they are visiting).   Eli would be able to assist Karen, to and from the airport and on the flight and travel to stay with family and would also assist with any personal care required.  Eli would also receive support from family members who are always keen to support both Karen and Eli but are just too far away.  If Eli goes Karen has no family support network in Argyll.  This trip, should they both be able to go, would not only be practical as Karen would receive the support required, it would also have a hugely positive impact on both the mental, emotional wellbeing for Eli and mental, emotional and physical wellbeing for Karen.  Not being able to go could heightened Karen’s stress level - with MS, heightened stress almost always results in a rapid worsening of physical symptoms, recurrence of old symptoms or start of new symptoms.  Currently Karen’s symptoms include: neurological pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, muscle spasm, ‘itchy blood’, blurry vision, imbalance and fog brain, resulting in poor self-esteem, lack of confidence and general fear. This trip would mean everything to both Karen and Eli, who just need to see their families.  When I asked Karen how she would feel about going to Norway with her mum, she said to me: ‘ Seeing my family would mean the world to me, they cannot come to me, as they are caring for a cousin, Therese, who is in her twenties and has had a stroke and has been left with an inoperable aneurism in her brain.   I want to see her desperately to give her a cuddle, to support her parents through this but I just as desperately need the support they can give me.  I just need a big Norwegian cuddle and I know my mum does too’.    Finance additional note. I do not have a figure for Council benefit and housing benefit, as Karen told me, these are paid directly to Argyll and Bute Council -Council tax and ACHA - Argyll Community Housing Assoc for rent.  I can if required contact the council to find out this figure)";"2015-06-10 11:54:41";"2015-07-09 11:47:35";"1436438855"

Susan has narcoleptic syndrome manifest by both narcolepsy and cataplexy.  This was diagnosed in 2013; at the time Susan had 2 jobs; Business Support Assistant with Welfare Rights at Wrexham County Council and Families First, Head Administrator.  Susan is having unplanned sleeps during the daytime which occur in inappropriate circumstances and are irresistible.   She also has frequent cataplectic attacks which can be spontaneous or triggered by emotion, including laughing.  Her body will flop sitting and she can fall to the ground if standing. Susan reports that she can have up to 30 attacks a day.  During the seizures, Susan loses function of her muscles in her legs, etc but she said that she can hear everything despite the seizures lasting up to a few minutes.   As you will see from my assessment, Susan’s health condition impacts significantly on every aspect of her life and seriously compromises her independence in relation to autonomy, management of routines, involvement within the community and health and safety. >   Significant risk to physical health through falls and subsequent injuries.  Susan can fall at any time and has little notice.  There is an increased risk if Susan is in an unfamiliar environment or outside.  This could potentially happen when Susan is crossing the road.  Susan does her best to minimise risks.  She walks around her home holding on to furniture and if she feels an attack coming on she can sometimes slide down a wall.  Susan tends to spend a lot of her time sitting safely on her couch.  She attempts activities of daily living (which could potentially cause more harm to her; such as cooking and showering) when there are other people around.>  The condition also poses a significant, high risk to Susan's emotional and mental well being as a result of the loss of independence.  Susan feels that she has lost autonomy, also her ability to be involved in her local community and social activities is significantly compromised.  Susan explains that her ability to manage her usual routines and activities of daily living is also at risk. The condition is impacting on every aspect of Susan's day to day life and Susan reports feeling as though she has lost her role, identity and social links which is making Susan very unhappy.Susan has explored the option of having a seizure dog and feels that this will make a huge difference to her life and enable her to be much more independent.  Susan has written a letter which I have included which explains, from her perspective, what having a dog would mean to her and the impact that this could potentially have upon her life.  I have also included an information leaflet which may assist you in the decision making process.My intention is to apply to several different charitable organisations in the hope that she will be able to purchase the dog.  The cost of the dog is £4,950.00.  I am well aware that this is a huge amount to request and therefore requesting a contribution towards this.I would appreciate it if you could take the time to carefully consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Please let me know if you require any further information to make your decision.RegardsLucy Powell and Melissa RogersSocial WorkerPhysical Disabilities Team";"2015-06-12 00:16:22";"2015-06-23 13:41:53";"1435063313"

One day, she collapsed at home due to the pain and was rushed into hospital where they discovered a Colloid Cyst putting pressure on her brain and also blocking the spinal fluid causing hydrocephalous.  She had two operations to shrink and remove the majority of the cyst, but has been left with a permanent brain injury as a result.  She now has delayed learning, an inability to carry out duties, short term memory loss , fatigue, anxiety, difficulty with attention and concentration, takes longer to think, excessive sleeping and a slowness in carrying out tasks.Due to these problems, while trying to return to work and normalcy, she ran up large debts and is working with the charity Step Change to pay back all she owes, they have helped her apply to the Sales People’s Charity to secure some funding to help with her utilities cost and that has helped her reduce her arrears and start to get back on track.  Currently, her boiler is extremely temperamental and she has spent the entire winter without heating or hot water.  She has been running electric heaters, but this has caused a huge spike in her bills, which has not helped her debt situation nor her anxiety and stress.  A working boiler would not only cut her bills, but provide her with a warm home and hot water to wash etc.  This would have a massive impact on her wellbeing, beyond the obvious improvements by having a warm home; she would also feel a lot calmer and able to deal with the day to day issues more easily as the stress and anxiety make the confusion she can feel worse.She has been told by Domestic and General that she is eligible for the Government’s ECO Boiler Scheme, but will have to pay £350 towards the cost.  This means that the government will pay for the rest (approx.. £2,000) but the amount is too high for her at the moment as any additional money she has is promised to debtors.  I have managed to source £150 towards that total.";"2015-06-29 14:54:30";"2015-08-28 15:01:15";"1440770475"

She also has  issues with nerves that causes lower back problems and is seeking help from Physiotherapists.  She started a part time Degree course with us in October 2014, she has always been creative, but due to her conditions hasn’t been successful in gaining employment.  However she has found that whilst preparing for the course and since starting the course she has noticed great benefits to her health and social well-being.  Yvonne finds that writing helps manage her thought processes and she seems to flourish when she is being creative. The process of drawing calms her nerves and helps distract from any voices. The course requires group work which helps Yvonne meet new people, make friends and network and build confidence.  Yvonne has has finally found what she feels that she should be doing and is good at it.  She feels confident and able to express herself.  She is really excited about where this course could take her in future career. Student is a mature student and has had poor health with hospital stays in the past, however she is managing her health far better now and feels that this is her time to study and gain employment. Currently she is exhausted from the first year and as she came straight from hospital she'd really appreciate a break to see a friend in Italy for a few days or a week.She has included that she needs a sofa as it became torn and no longer fit to sit on and had to be thrown out.  Yvonne is in debt to catalogues which is causing her stress to pay back, because when she was in college (previous to this course) she purchased most of her resources; paper, material, fabrics, folders, paints, equipment for her portfolio etc without any additional assistance.  Yvonne also lost a lot of weight when she went through a period of poor mental health last year, but has put back a lot of weight, so has had to buy new clothes, she has done this from a catalogues and needs to pay them back.Student is studying a part time course therefore she only receives a Tuition Fee Loan from Student Finance England  - part time students are not eligible to any maintenance provision at all.  In my opinion the student is currently receiving the appropriate health benefits for her conditions and is unable to work.  Yvonne applied to the hardship fund of the University and was awarded £300, which has gone some way to covering her ‘start-up’ costs of the course.  Yvonne has applied to one other charitable organization but wasn't successful.We hope that you will consider Yvonne’s case as she is falling short of money to be successful on this course, from meeting with Yvonne, I feel that any help you can offer would make a very positive change to her and boost her chances of success in the future.

I am in contact with Miss Wright on a regular basis as I feel she needs a lot of support to get through this difficult time.";"2015-07-30 11:11:57";"2015-10-28 04:44:49";"1446025489"

Mrs MacLeod suffers with chronic back pain caused by adegenerative spine condition which severely restricts her mobility and physical activity. MsMacLeod is able to walk very short distances with a 4 wheel walker or crutches but needs to restrepeatedly and finds walking even a few steps extremely painful.Ms MacLeod is on numerous pain killers and medications, including oral morphine but she is still inpain every day. She tends to also rely on alcohol if in severe pain and feeling upset by thedeterioration in her health. Ms MacLeod was a very active lady who enjoyed outdoor pursuits,horse riding, sports, but she is struggling to get about her immediate vicinity due to chronic pain.Ms Macleod has no family nearby to help and is new to the Shrewsbury area, having had torelocate due to living in a first floor flat with no working lift, where she would often becomehousebound. She has support from members of her new local church and they help wherepossible with transport to appointments and shopping. Miss MacLeod has to pay for taxis for otherjourneys when others cannot assist or the bus stops are too far to manage.There is a local Post Office, shop and facilities not far from her property but too far to walk to. MsMacLeod is desperate to be independent for as long as possible and hates having to rely onothers. She desperately needs a mobility scooter to get out locally, remain as independent aspossible and feel more in control. She is currently unable to attend any local social activities asshe cannot get to them, cannot stand up for long and therefore has limited chance to become partof the wider community. She has a tendency to turn to alcohol to cope with the pain and lonelinessof her current situation. A scooter would allow her to regain control and independence, meet newpeople, get out in the fresh air, attend social events and feel that she belongs to her community.She is keen to mix with others and make new friends but her current opportunities are extremelylimited so she spends a lot of time at home alone.Ms MacLeod has no savings and is currently overdrawn at the bank due to the unforeseen costs of moving. She is in receipt of sickness benefit and Personal Independence Payments. She has no family in a position to help and no other financial support. A mobility scooter would enhance herincrease her independence and I hope you may be able to assist Ms MacLeod in some way.Please contact me at the above address if you need any further information.Yours sincerelyZoe HydeFloating Support Officer";"2015-07-30 14:32:27";"2015-10-07 12:27:04";"1444217224"

SJ used to work 100hour weeks as a lawyer, she owned her home and was raising her son mainly on her own. But her life fell apart when she had a heart attack. She lost her home as she could not afford to pay the mortgage or bills and had no one to help her and her son. Miss Sterling currently has the following medical issues: Depression, back/spine damage, heart damage, anaemia, perforated ulcer and most recently has had ovarian cancer which she is now in remission from. She struggles with her son who is a very domineering teenager, who demands money off of her constantly and can be very aggressive and verbally abusive to her if he doesn't get exactly what he wants so SJ usually ends up with little or no money in a week because of him. I have referred her to MIND for therapy and confidence building and had to do a safeguarding for her to Social Services. The reason I am requesting this funding for her decorating is that SJ hardly ever leaves the flat because of her physical and mental health issues but because of her lack of funding is unable to decorate and basically lives/sleeps in the lounge because the rest of the flat feels uninhabitable to her. As she lives in an upstairs flat a carpet is a must for her and the housing association and will help her health as she feels the cold severely and will help her to feel at home. Being able to paint the flat (or get someone to paint it for her) would again help her feel happier in her home that she spends most of her time in. This woman is so in need of an deserving of help if you could help her it would mean the world to her and she would be so grateful.";"2015-08-04 16:18:09";"2015-10-06 17:42:17";"1444149737"

During this time Adele had a relapse and had to give up her part time job due to mental health problems and we spent the next couple of months trying to get her the benefits she was entitled to.We claimed a Discretionary Housing Payment to cover this cost in the interim period and managed eventually to swap homes to her present 2 bed property. This was done very quickly and with hindsight Adele should have spent more time looking at the house before signing the tenancy, there were a multitude of repair works that required putting right but because Adele had signed for the house in its present condition her landlord Railway Housing would not put many things right, leaving Adele to do this on her own.What was missing was a shower which Adele needs because or her labrynthitis and vertigo she finds it difficult getting in and out of a bathtub, Railway Housing will not help with this so we approached City of York Council Aids and Adaptations who assessed Adele but were unable to help other than fit a handrail.Adele has started to decorate the bathroom and funded the partial tiling by herself and will put any spare cash toward getting a shower but the whole expense at once is too great.Adele cannot approach the Social Fund for help as she has had one in the past year and not paid back, ironically this was to carpet the hallway in the house that she has just left.Any help toward this would be greatly appreciated by this family I am sure, Adele never asks me for help with anything that she is not entitled to and we have exhausted all other avenues of funding available in the York area.";"2015-08-10 09:43:16";"2015-10-28 04:52:21";"1446025941"

THT have been assisting Ms Britton since 2014. Although a British national, historically, Ms Britton lived in America for 20 years, but was diagnosed as HIV+ in 2006. Ms Britton returned to live in the UK in 2014, but fell very ill thereafter. Deemed not to be entitled to social security benefits for the first three months of her return to the UK (due to the Habitual Residence legislature).Ms Britton fell ill at a time that she was homeless and destitute and was admitted to hospital with a CD4 count of only 3. Upon her family learning that Ms Britton was living with HIV, they shunned her. Upon discharge from hospital, Ms Britton lived variously with friends for the duration July to October, 2014. Finally, in March 2015 Birmingham City Council allocated Ms Britton a tenancy under the homeless provisions. THT then assisted Ms Britton with making an application to the Local Welfare Provision for white goods for her kitchen and subsequently we applied to the Heinz, Anna and Carol Kroch Foundation who kindly paid for a microwave. However, Ms Brittan still requires the following items for her home that we have identified available from Argos on line via the internet:- Dining Table £39.99 [171/5507]Dining Chairs £39.99 [331/8366]Wardrobe £59.99 [224/8877]If the Margaret's Fund were to be able to contribute to the cost of all or any of these three items then your assistance would be invaluable to Ms Brittan. Now that Ms Brittan has been allocated a tenancy of her own her prospects of compliance with medication are increased and thus a return to severe ill health markedly reduced. However, I am aware that a relapse in ill health is still possible for Ms Brittan due to the risk of premature onset of HIV related dementia (prompted by the extent of her prior ill health and the late treatment of her HIV+ symptomology). To that end, any endeavours which can be made to enhance her quality of life in the present would be very warmly received.

Georgina seperated from her husband in January as she had been on the sick for so long that her sick money stopped and she was no longer able to contribute towards the household expenses, as she previously had.  Georgina's husband and Mother in Law became very abusive and critical of Georgina.  She was already feeling extremely depressed and anxious as a result of her numerous health problems, but she was unable to cope with the constant verbal abuse and left her husband.  Following this, Georgina was dismissed from work in August on the grounds of capability due to ill health.  Georgina has never claimed benefits before and didn’t realise that she would be able to claim anything so has been without any income since January until now.  her daughter who is also in receipt of benefits has been supporting her.  Georgina recently made a claim for ESA after receving some appropriate advice and I have also supported her to make a claim for PIP, we are awaiting the application form.Georgina worked for South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust for 25 years at Guisborough Hospital.  Georgina suffers with Pain Syndrome in her feet (this is the condition which has resulted in her dismissal from work as she is in constant pain and therefore cannot do a lot of walking or standing), Barrett's Osophogus, Heart Murmur and Temperal Arteritis as well as Depression.  When discussing the PIP descriptors with Georgina she stated that she is always unwell and never has any good days, she just has days when the pain isn't as bad as other days.  Georgina is extremely emotional and overwhelmed by her current situation.  She is distressed that her husband and mother in law could treat her in such a away when she really needed them to support her.  This is really affecting her ability to think clearly and make plans for her future.  Georgina needs a stable home environment so that she can  start to make sense of her life and move forward.  She has a lot to contend with regarding her health so having basic essentials and some home comforts will help to alleviate any further pain and discomfort.

We are currently under going a mandatory review into her benefits as we believe she is eligible we are just unable to provide the official evidence without a Home Office documentation which has a £65 fee. Andzela was housed following a hospital stay which was extended by 8 weeks whilst the two local authorities battled who had a duty towards her. On July 2nd she was finally discharged however she has not received any money since this date. We have been relying on food bank vouchers for her however we have now exhausted this due to the restrictions around how many a person is allowed in a certain period of time. Due to her very complex health issues this a huge concern for us as food is vital for her medication and health. Without appropriate nutrition it is highly likely Andzela will end up back in hospital. Andzela also has no belongings and the only clothes she has are what the hospital donated on discharge. These are ill fitting and not suitable for the unpredictable British weather as she does not have a coat or any warm clothing, on top of this she has no under wear garments at all which is both uncomfortable and embarrassing for her. Andzela has a 16 year old son and 2 younger grandchildren who are all under local authority care however Andzela is allowed to visit. She is currently unable to afford travel and has expressed embarrassment of her children/grandchildren seeing her in her current state coupled with the fact she is unable to provide them with as little as a bag of sweets when visiting. Andzela's accommodation also comes with a service charge fee of £18.40 a week which she has been unable to pay. This has put her under considerable stress and she now has arrears of over £150. Andzela is also currently unable to afford prescriptions that are outside what she is entitled to for free such as the HIV & diabetes medication. This caused a recent admission into hospital because she did not have the relevant medication however she has now been discharged and we are awaiting a response from our application for a HC2 medical exemption application. This lady is very vulnerable and has faced considerable barriers at every avenue. We are unable to provide any financial assistance and we are trying our best to provide support to her however this is rapidly going beyond our remit.

Kenny has been employed as a joiner all his life, until very recently, when he was forced to take early retirement due to being diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease which has affected his healthElizabeth’s cerebral palsy affects the entire length of her right side, although she is mobile she has difficulty weight bearing for any length of time and has to use a mobility aid to help her move around her caravan.   Her CP results in weakness, loss of control and spasms which are mostly in her right leg.  Her right arm is severely affected by a lack of movement and control, it is in a permanent upright position and the right hand is permanently clenched in a fist which at times, restricts her ability to carry out nearly all daily activities, such as, dressing, personal care, eating and food preparation, and she has frequent falls which has caused many injuries over the years.Due to her cerebral palsy, Elizabeth has over compensated, using her left side more than the right, the increased pressure resulted in Elizabeth having to have a hip replacement which knocked her back even more Elizabeth and Kenny live a quiet modest lifestyle, and although we have know them for over eighteen years, they are very private people and have not encouraged regular visits with our support worker until recently, when they have admitted they are struggling financially.  Both Elizabeth and Kenny are currently receiving benefits, their support worker has identified a shortfall and organised an assessment of this and Kenny is currently seeking ESA payments which should help them immensely To generate more income they rent out a small piece of land that they own and for that they receive £5,000 per annum (£96 per week) they also grow their own vegetables and keep chickens to provide them with eggs and meat.  Whilst visiting Elizabeth recently, the support worker found her just about to put new bedding onto her bed and offered to do it for her.  She noticed that the mattress was very old and considerably worn, to the point that one of the springs had come through the fabric cover.  On mentioning this, Elizabeth said that she sleeps in the one position she can get comfy in, and that is why the spring had come through and she hadn’t replaced it for over ten years, due to lack of finances.  The support worker offered to turn it over, but was told that apparently they had already done this a few years and the other side was just as bad.  Therefore I write to ask Margaret’s Fund if they would be able to grant £199.99 to enable Elizabeth to purchase a new double mattress which would help her to get a good night sleep comfortably ";"2015-09-01 10:58:18";"2015-11-16 06:46:12";"1447677972"

In  Heathers own words:The walker is fantastic: It has slower brakes thing on that you tighten a wheel to the walker wheel so you can control how fast it will allow the wheels to go so it can't run away from me! Also for no extra charge they are able to link both hand brakes so they work together with only the left, good, hand, they can change this back free of charge at any time.Its the perfect height for now and forever!Less stress on my shoulders, neck, arms, back which will help reduce the pressure which contributes to me getting ulnaritis and trigeminal neuralgia which I have now and is extremely painful!No need to change the handles when my cast comes off as this is a much better position and perfect for support especially with having the problems I do re fibromyalgia and ME. Having this will mean I could walk outdoors now which I can't do at the moment - I wouldn't be able to use my other walker for about 3 months depending how physio goes after having cast off as they recommend not weight baring until the muscles build up again.The cost to buy this mobility aid is £600.

Eucharia and children’s living situation is precarious, she is currently living in a third floor one bedroom flat but has been offered a two room dwelling on the first floor in another borough as a better alternative. She will have to share kitchen, bathroom and toilet with three other people. This is a difficult situation for the family and does not provide stability for Ryan who should have started school this month but cannot because of the impending move the exact time of which is not clear. Neither does it lend itself to better safeguarding of the children by Eucharia. She herself is exhausted from single handedly caring for all three children round the clock, amidst meetings, hospital appointments and school run when Ryan was still attending nursery.All of the children are currently subject to a protection plan due to Mother being charged with 'child cruelty or neglect' May 2015, following an incident in which another child she was temporarily taking care of sustained burns to her feet due being deeped in hot water and getting scalded as a result. She had pleaded guilty to the offence and was sentenced in July 2015. The decision was made to present the case at an initial child protection conference and a decision was made to make all children subject to a protection plan under the category of physical abuse due to the potential risk posed by their mother.  Eucharia had been caring for this child on behalf of a friend on and off previously and there had been no concerns reported until then. Eucharia's only child at the time was a known to the Local authority and receiving child in need support under the no recourse to public funds team since 2011.  All  agencies involved and  present at the conference  had identified positive parenting in relation to Ryan, with no safeguarding concerns as he was thriving under her care.Eucharia has no recourse to public funds and therefore is only being supported by the local authority with £76 a week for her children, and accomodation. She is not allowed to work however, currently even if she could she would struggle to find child care. She has no support from Ryan's father who lives in Nigeria although their relationship has long since broken down. The Twin's father is equally not interested in hers or his children's welfare and has refused to acknowledge his responsibility towards her even under pressure from the local authority. Eucharia therefore is completely destitute and is dependent on whatever she can get from charity.Eucharia is managing with a tremendous amount of fortitude to make do with what she receives for her children from the local authority. She has also been given a year long supply of formula milk by the Homerton hospital but she has said that it is not enough for both babies and runs out quickly they consume 3 tins of formula a week between them yet she gets vouchers the equivalent of £100 for 3 months supply at a time. Her well being is severely affect considering the fact that none of her children's Fathers are involved, she is unable now to access the food bank at Cara as it would be too long a journey to make on a regular basis to collect food items many of which may not even suit her needs. It is difficult for one to imagine how she is coping on so little however, she has a few friends from her church who have been a big help in the period following the birth of the twins. The local authority assisted her with a double buggy and baby cots. She is tired and stressed out her HIV status notwithstanding and with very few options if any.

HA8 8LWI am writing to support an application for grant funding to assist Ms Bumpus to have a respite break away from home.Ms Bumpus is a 44 year old, severely disabled female suffering from ME, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She is also allergic to certain foods and dust. She is currently in receipt of higher rate Disability Living Allowance for mobility and care and has a 22.5 hour a week care package, which was put in place by Barnet Social Services. This supports her with cooking, cleaning and personal care. She lives in a fully adapted bungalow and uses a wheelchair on the rare occasions she is well enough to venture outside. Ms Bumpus lives alone and is quite isolated due to her condition and very restricted with respect to social activities. She is extremely proactive in trying hard to improve her condition but she is very limited in what she is able to accomplish. For example, having a shower can totally deplete her energy. I believe that she would find a recuperative break extremely beneficial as it would help her to better manage her physical health and give her access to facilities she wouldn’t normally be able to have use of, such as hydrotherapy, specialist dieticians, counselling and spiritual and emotional support. As well as this it would give her a chance to socialise with other individuals in similar circumstances and form friendships.Burrswood is the only respite centre in the country which specialises in CFS and as such seems the best respite care for Ms Bumpus. She would greatly benefit from having a respite break away from home, as it would allow her to energise herself and have something to look forward to. I am requesting a contribution of £200 towards funding for 14 days respite care, as it can take Ms Bumpus 2-3 days to fully recover from a long journey, so that would give her 10 days to make full use of the facilities. The full cost of the break would be £4,130. It is necessary for the period of respite care to start on a Saturday, as that is the only day her carer can drive her, there and back.We have applied to the Frederick Andrews Convalescent Trust and been successfully awarded £1,000 towards the break. However, this is on the proviso that the respite case break takes place before 31/10/15.Burrswood hospital in Kent have agreed provisional dates of 17/10/15 – 31/10/15. Unfortunately I was off sick for two weeks which held up the application process.

She has been a client of mine for almost 8 years now I when I was saddened to learn that some nine months ago she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, blood cancer. Her symptoms include debilitating pain caused by bone damage (fracture in her spine), difficulty walking, standing or seating.  Ms James has completed first part of her Chemo-Therapy and also Radio Therapy and will start second course in two weeks time.  She lives alone and has neither family nor friends to support her.  She arrived in the UK as a refugee and recently was transferred from her housing in Nottingham to Surrey area where she will continue to receive specialist cancer treatment in Royal Marsden Hospital as she was not able to receive the specialist treatment where she previously resided. She has had to pay a substantial amount for the moving costs and house repairs, and making the environment suitable living conditions for herself. During cancer therapy, Ms James developed severe side effects and had to be hospitalised several times.  When attending any appointments the client has to use taxi and cab services to and from the hospital or GP.  It is virtually impossible for her to walk any distance even if it is only a couple of meters to the bus stop.  This had put incredible pressure on her finances and most of the benefit money goes on paying for taxi services or foods deliveries and Ms James does not have enough money for bills and for food at the end. Due to her ill health she is unable to cook meals from scratch has to buy easily prepared or ready made-food which becomes quite expensive. She also takes a great deal of vitamins and supplements whilst on her cancer treatment.  We kindly ask for financial support for Ms James to assist her with high costs of food, fuel, travel costs and winter clothing. She is extremely lonely and has only 2 friends she made in Nottingham as she is unable to join any social clubs due to her deteriorating health. I speak to her on an almost daily basis to provide her with moral support and strength as well as speak about her doctor's appointments and her health.We would be extremely grateful if you could help her";"2015-09-25 16:31:56";"2016-01-07 08:30:44";"1452177044"

Mrs Butt presents with depression and anxiety, which has impacted on her physical health greatly over the past year, result in dramatic weight loss and fatigue, and has impacted on her self-care and parenting capacity, which has had a knock on effect with the children’s behaviour and engagement in education. The main reason for applying for the grant is that the family have moved suddenly as a result of the ongoing domestic abuse subjected on the family by Mrs Butt’s ex-husband.  We have been able to apply for many items from the Discretionary assistance funds; however, they do not provide grants for carpets/flooring, and given Mrs Butt’s ill health, this is of concern.  Ideally, we are keen as a service, to support this family to have a fresh start, and the strength to move on from the unfortunate circumstances they found themselves in.  I will continue to support this family and assist them with their ongoing issues.Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information.

She was given this tenancy in September 2015.  Prior to this she had been living in both bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation since February 2013. Rebecca who is of Irish descent was born and raised in Dublin she has 3 other brothers and sisters. Growing up as a boy Rebecca says she was always aware of her feelings of being different that she felt as if she was in the wrong body. However she tried to ignore these feelings having a number of relationships with women and as result has a daughter. This situation was not to last and in 1988 Rebeca started on her “journey” to becoming a womanShe was still based in Dublin at this time and owned a successful hairdressing business and modelling agency. However one of the consequences of her Trans gender status was that her business started to fail as clients stopped using her agency. Her family also rejected her; she reminds me that this was a time in the late 1980s in Ireland where to issue of transgender identity was unheard of to most of the population.This in turn led to her increasingly using drugs and alcohol at this time as she says to “blot out the pain and enter oblivion”She was then diagnosed HIV positive in 1989, at this time there was no effective treatment for HIV and Rebecca said she thought she would die soon and this further added to her sense of worthlessness.Rebecca left Ireland in 1990 living in London as she felt more accepted as a transgender woman and she could receive effective treatment for her HIV. However she returned to Ireland to care for her mother who was diagnosed with a terminal illness, however this lead to her making herself  “intentionally homeless” which she says she did not realise but felt she had no choice but to leave London to care for her mother for a period of 18months.  Whilst she had stopped taking alcohol and drugs thinking her health would not suffer, she had stopped taking her HIV medication so she started to become unwell. On her return to London in 2013 she resumed her HIV medication, but because she had now developed a drug resistance it has taken until June 2015 for her to obtain an undetectable viral load.Rebecca has a strong religious faith as a Roman Catholic; it is this faith which she credits with giving her strength to get through the very difficult periods in her life. Rebecca has now, following 2 years in hostel accommodation, been given the tenancy of a one bedroom flat. She sees this as now giving her the stability to take control of her life she says she does not want to spend the rest of her life on benefits. She would like to go back to working in events or P.R. setting up a business in fashion/modelling where she can provide employment to other people. She has already given classes to other service users at Cara in hair and make- upRebecca receives Employment Support Allowance and Personal Independent Payments.

A property became available with Coast & Country Housing which suited Samantha’s needs and she has accepted the property on 27/11/2015. This property also has a wet room for Samantha’s incontinence issues.Samantha has a specialist consultant at James Cook Hospital called Mr Ballard in the Gynaecologist department. She has also made a claim for Personal Independence Payment and is awaiting a decision. Samantha is isolated as she has no family support to help her with her care needs.Samantha’s previous property was furnished and she was unable to take any of the furniture with her. She desperately needs a washing machine to be able to clean her soiled bed sheets and clothing. Samantha needs some mattress protectors and spare bedding as due to her condition she is unable to control her bladder through the night and often has accidents.Samantha needs a fridge freezer to be able to store food. Samantha is on a very low income and it will become costly buying food daily. It is also difficult for Samantha to go out of the house on a daily basis to buy food due to her incontinence and walking difficulties. Due to Samantha’s condition she needs to be able to cook healthy food. Samantha needs a gas cooker to be able to cook nutritious quick easy meals. Due to Samantha’s numerous health problems, she really cannot afford to become unwell.";"2015-12-01 04:35:47";"2016-01-19 09:24:35";"1453217075"

Mr Blackley is 57 year old and has osteoarthritis, (he has already had a right knee and left hip complete replacement and will require further replacement joint surgery in the not to distant future), he also has psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis and so needs to have a bath daily, which he can manage with a bath seat lift, to applycertain topical psoriasis treatments and so we need to retain a bath.  A bathroom adaptation would greatly benefit them by allowing Mrs Blackleyto fully shower every day, due to the hidradentis suppurativa which manifest in constantly weeping puss filled abscesses it is difficult to stay clean and hygienic just with washing at the hand basin. Keeping the bath would allow Mr Blackley to soak in his psoriasis treatments, a warm bath also eases his arthritis pain. Unfortunately funding through statutory services (a disabled facility grant which has been given by East Lothian Council in the amount of £6456.80) would only cover the walkin shower part of the adaptation. The estimated cost of the bathroom adaptation is £65000.  As this is a significant cost we are approaching a number of trusts and charities to raise the required funds collectively.

Lindsey was identified as vulnerable due to her circumstances and was therefore referred to me.  Lindsey is a victim of domestic violence.  She has, until recently, been living in a refuge with her boys until her ex-partner who she was fleeing, found where she was staying.  She then spent some time in a hotel funded by the Foundation Project in Middlesbrough and then in a B&B.  We received a phone call from the Homeless section at the Council advising us that Lindsey was in desperate need as there was no further funding available to continue paying for a B&B.  We identified a three bedroom property in a low demand area that was suitable for Lindsey and her son’s needs.  	Lindsey literally had nothing when she came to see us, but the clothes that they were stood in as she had left her family home in a hurry.  When she left the refuge she had to leave her bed and other personal items there as she couldn’t carry them all.When I met Lindsey I arranged for some free items to be delivered to her that were available from a local project.  The project didn’t have any beds available so delivered a second hand sofa and two chairs for the boys to sleep on, along with some bedding and other small bits and pieces.  The Foundation Project gave her a microwave and a kettle.  I also arranged for our impact team to collect her bed and other personal items from the refuge for her, so they all had something to sleep on.  Lindsey has arthritis in her back and as she was sleeping on the floor it was having a detrimental effect on her wellbeing.  When Lindsey moved into the property she couldn’t afford to put any gas or electricity onto her meters, or buy any food.  I arranged for her energy company to loan her some credit for her meter that she will pay back when she starts topping up and we also issued her with a food bank voucher.  Lindsey’s boys – Terry (17) and Connor (15) are very quiet.  They don’t hold eye contact and don’t really engage in conversation.  Lindsey states that what they have seen has had a profound effect on them, as they were unable to protect their mum.  The Police have been involved on numerous occasions and Lindsey’s ex-partner has been served with a Non-Molestation Order.  Lindsey is determined that this is going to be a fresh start for her and her children.  She has been in this relationship for 9 years and also has two daughters to her ex-partner, who have been removed from her care, due to the level of domestic violence.    Terry and Connor and also Lindsey’s other children; have witnessed a great deal during Lindsey’s last relationship and have been affected in many ways.  They have lived within a very chaotic and violent environment that has had a detrimental impact on their self-esteem and confidence.  Their schooling has regularly been disrupted and they have struggled to keep up with their school work.  Terry is currently not engaging with any work or training activities therefore; I am going to refer him to our Community Investment Team for some careers guidance.I am hopeful that this will be a fresh start for Lindsey and that she is able to regain custody of her daughters.  In order for her to do this, she first needs to set up a safe and secure home environment, that meets the basic needs of everyone in the family and settle her life down into an orderly routine.   Lindsey’s benefits have been sanctioned and she therefore doesn’t have enough money to live on.  Lindsey was previously on JSA but she was sanctioned for not doing enough job searches.  Lindsey states that things were getting so bad at home, that she was unable to even think about looking for work.  We have supported her to make a new claim for ESA, but this will take up to three weeks to be processed.  Lindsey has moved into a low demand area of Middlesbrough due to the urgency of her situation.  She is new to the area and already feeling vulnerable.  Having curtains up at the windows would provide some proivacy and security for Lindsey and her children and would allow them to feel safe in their home.

Respite would allow her a break to herself where she was able to enjoy some time looking after herself and not have to worry about her children. The family home is also in disrepair as there are ongoing legal proceedings with the local council and landlord regarding this. This situation exacerbates the symptoms of depression, but due to the mother being the sole carer for the children as their father has been deported she is unable to deal with this problem sufficiently. The constant looking after the children is also affected by the mothers osteoarthritis which can be incredibly painful for the mother, but again due to having three young children this remains a second priority.

She started looking after them and became their carer so made a claim for Income Support.

She was sexually abused by them & forced to take part in terrorist activities. She contracted HIV at the age of 11 as a result of being repeatedly raped but she had no access to free health care or treatment. She eventually managed to escape in 2002 & came to the UK. She arrived on a visitor’s visa & worked illegally to support herself until she was arrested in an immigration raid in 2009 & convicted of possession of false documents, & she served a 6 month prison sentence. She was diagnosed with multiple tumours whilst in prison as a result of Kaposi’s Sarcoma, a rare HIV related cancer which affects the skin & internal organs of people with advanced immunosuppression. Ms Agu developed the condition due to being HIV positive for so many years without accessing any medical treatment, & underwent surgery & chemotherapy whilst in prison to remove the tumours. Ms Agu claimed asylum whilst in prison and was granted 3 years Limited Leave to Remain in 2010. This expired in March 2013 and despite her having applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain in November 2012 her application had not been processed by the time her leave expired. Ms Agu had been in receipt of Employment Support Allowance but the Home Office  informed the DWP that Ms Agu is no longer had recourse to public funds until her application for ILR was processed and her ESA  was suspended as a result. Ms Agu does not have the right to work or claim benefits at present, nor is she entitled to asylum support so is in a legal limbo. We have referred Ms Agu’s case to a solicitor for advice. Ms Agu is entirely dependant on charity applications & the charity of friends from church who help her to buy food & toiletries & top up her electricity meter, as well as Food Parcels, to survive.

Wasilat came to the UK from Nigeria in 2004 after fleeing domestic violence and poverty.   Wasilat was married with 3 children in Nigeria but was driven out of the family home, by her husband, who used to physically abuse both herself and the children.  This led to her becoming homeless and destitute and her children being dispersed throughout Lagos.   Sometime after she met a man who said he would help her to escape her desperate situation and brought her to the UK but abandoned her soon after they arrived.  Her children, although now fully grown adults, remain in Nigeria with a distant relative.  She is currently awaiting a decision from the Home Office regarding her Leave to Remain application.HealthWasilat was diagnosed with HIV in May 2012 after presenting at her local hospital with acute confusion and cough.  At the time her immune system was very weak with a CD4 cell count of 14 cells, the normal should be above 400.  She later developed a chest infection which progressed to Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP), and was later diagnosed with HIV Encephalitis which is an HIV associated dementia.  She also suffers from painful joints and night sweats.NeedWasilat is supported by Southwark Social Services under the Section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948.  She receives a subsistence payment of £50.20 per week in cash which she uses to buy food and pay for any travel required, she also receives assistance with accommodation through Social Services until a decision is made by the Home Office.

Janet was born in Nigeria and came to the UK in 2003.  Janet was living in extreme poverty in Nigeria so when her sister’s boyfriend, who was living in the UK at the time, offered to pay for her to come to the London and help her to find a job and she agreed.   When she arrived at the airport she was met by an older lady who took her to a residence in the East of London.   She explained that over the next few days she discovered that she had been brought to the flat in order to have sex with men for money.   Janet stayed at this property for 3 weeks and complied until it became unbearable and she ran away.  She did not know where she was going, she wanted to return home to Nigeria, but the lady who met her at the airport had suggested that she keep her passport for her for safe keeping, and she was too scared to go back to retrieve it.  She called her sister back in Nigeria and expressed her desire to return home to Nigeria.  Her sister begged her to stay in the UK as life in Nigeria was hard.  Her sister gave her a number of a friend who was living in Shepherds Bush, who agreed for her to stay for a short while.  Janet still has no fixed abode and is currently sofa surfing.  She is awaiting a decision from the home office regarding her Leave to Remain application.HealthIn 2010 Janet was feeling unwell, she explained that she was sweating, had no appetite and had uncontrollable coughing.  She presented herself to her G.P who immediately called an ambulance to take her hospital.  When she arrived at the hospital she was given a test for HIV which came back as positive.   In February 2012 Janet was diagnosed with diabetes and also suffered a minor stroke.  She stated that she woke up one morning and fell out of the bed in which she was sleeping.  The occupants of the house heard the commotion and came running to see what the problem was.  On observing Janet it appeared as if she was suffering a stroke as her face had dropped on one side.  They suggested that an ambulance should be called but she resisted in fear of being deported.   It took a lot of encouragement to finally persuade her to go to the hospital where it was confirmed that she had indeed suffered a minor stroke.  NeedJanet has no leave to remain in the UK and is awaiting a decision from the home office.   She has no income and is currently sofa surfing.  She relies heavily on our foodbank here at Cara where she receives weekly food parcels.

In brief, Dorothy has had a very traumatic life from being seriously abused from the age of 3, she married as soon as she turned 18 to a man who even punched her in the face knocking her out on the wedding night then he continued to abuse her in every way for 25 years. Unfortunately Dorothy had been conditioned to accept this as normal all her life so kept quiet for 25 years.In 2008 Dorothy seriously attacked at work by a person of 6`6"" and weighting 25 aprox stones,it took 3 fully maned police cars with crews wearing riot gear and with cs gas and baton`s drawn to arrest the individual, so you can imaging how this attack effected Dorothy.  Sadly because the attacker was 18 and under the umbrella of social services care, when he was taken to court for the attack upon Dorothy the judge let him off with a warning. he was sent on a months long holiday to his family in the Bahamas whilst Dorothy was left with life changing physical and mental disabilities and in permanent pain, Because she was unable to work and of ""no use"" to her husband, his violence towards her intensified and became a daily occurrence and she was forced to sleep on the floor with the dog where he deemed she belonged. This continued unreported and un noticed for a further 4 years until in 2002 when help was sought by her gp. the local council rehoused her into a bungalow  the same day under the threat of violence, she left the house that day with no ,more than the clothes she stood in and a small over night case and though she was still to sleep on the floor she was at least in no danger of being beaten, kicked or raped. she gradually got bits for her new home, mostly from freecycle and later from charity shops when her benefits were sorted out for her. so in that respect her home is functional, furnished and livable.Dorothy health has increasingly got worse over the years, she is on so many drugs to try and control the ever present pain and now has been diagnosed with heart failure which causes her extreme tiredness and difficulty in breathing. The reason i am contacting you is because she is in desperate need of an electric wheelchair so she can be taken out. An ideal chair would be one which enable her to ""drive""  when she was able and for a carer to be able to take control from behind when she tired  and is unable to do it herself. Sadly she is unable to get any help from the NHS because she can get about indoors with the help of a carer so doesnt need a chair for both inside and outside and this apparently deems her unable to get any help for a wheelchair.I have been scouring the internet for months now and found a suitable chair which i am sure would be perfect for her i have copied and pasted details below. After talking to the owner , this one is 10 years old and it transpires the rear control doesnt actually work. it was on ebay and the auction has now ended but it still shows up when you enter the details below.Sunrise Quickie Salsa R Rehab Electric Wheelchair, with separate attendant controller to enable carer to guide chair if required.Used a few times and still in excellent condition, looks like newElectric Riser (approx 12"")Electric TiltManual ReclineAttendant controllerQuick Release to use FreewheelLightsIndicatorsSeat BeltPuncture Proof TyresHeadrestFlip Up ArmrestSwing Away ControllerAdjustable and Removable Leg RestsI am asking on Dorothy`s behalf if you could maybe source a similar chair and maybe it might be within your bounds as a charity to help her financially as she has no money to speak of other than the benefits she receives and this goes straight out on paying for care, incontinence products and heating she spends the minimal amount on food as it is for her like many a choice between heating and eating. She is pretty desperate to be able to go outside again etc or even at a later date if she could save enough maybe to go on a sun paper holiday (save tokens from the paper she has been told ) as she hasnt had a holiday since her ""Honeymoon"" in 1977I have been in contact freedom powerchairs,email address nfo@freedompowerchairs.org.u tel no 07515505337 and i spoke to a gentleman called Martin Osment to discussMrs Clarks needs, predicermant etc and have today received this email from him From:	Freedom Powerchairs <info@freedompowerchairs.org.uk>To:	aa <dorothyc420@aol.com>Date:	Tue, 26 Apr 2016 12:13The list price for the spec you ask for is over £6,000.

Faye suffers from severe and enduring mental health problems. She has suffered abuse in the past and this had led to numerous admissions into psychiatric care due to the levels of her self harm and suicidal attempts. Faye is now working hard towards her recovery and has started volunteering at her local church for adult with learning disabilities. Faye feels committed to this work and gains a lot of personal satisfaction from helping others with needs of their own. The month of May is however a very difficult time for Faye as it triggers memories of the abuse she experienced. Faye has previously had funds from social services to fund a respite break for her for this difficult period within the year. However because Faye is now managing all her social care needs, she is no longer eligible for care and support. In addition the areas of support and funding have changed. Because of these 2 factors,  Faye will no longer have access to funds for a respite break. Faye plans to save over the next year for her respite break in May 2017 but would greatly appreciate any funds for this current year. Faye is unable to ask her parents for support in relation to this as she is paying off a debt of £820 to them for the rent deposit and rent in advance that they paid for her when she moved into her own flat. Faye is paying them £60 per week for this but once this is paid off then she will  be able to save for funds to pay for her own respite breaks. If Margarets Fund are able to support Faye financially with this request, Norfolk County Council request a covering letter from your charity that states the amount awarded and the reason for the award. Please contact me if you require any further information. Kind regards. Eva Kolanowska";"2016-04-27 15:34:52";"2016-06-01 14:43:18";"1464788598"

She suffers extreme pain, poor mobilty and fatigue.  Catherine lives very close to the MS Centre, where support is given to many people with various long term conditions, however, she has to rely on her husband being available to drive her and would love to have the independence to head round whenever suits and to attend classes, self management workshops, receive the various therapies and most importantly have peer support.  Catherine often feels lonely and isolated, and greatly benefits from social interaction with others affected by similar conditions.   Catherine would also love to have the independence to enjoy the beautiful scenery, which surrounds us in Argyll.  Having a scooter would allow Catherine the ability to head up to the local beauty spots – the Crinan Canal, the loch and the local woods and take advantage of the accessible paths there.  It was the scenery that attracted Catherine to leave city life for a rural living, and she misses getting out to enjoy the beauty around her.  Catherine also misses being able to get out to her local shops, her husband can drive her to the shops, however, once there she does not have the strength and stamina to shop.  A scooter would allow her the ability to shop once again and would also keep Catherine engaged in the local community.  Getting out in the town would allow Catherine to meet up with neighbours and friends.  This independence will increase Catherine's self esteem, confidence and social interaction. I believe having a mobility scooter will be very empowering and will improve Catherine's physical and mental and emotional wellbeing.  Engaging once more with the community with be of great benefit to her.    ";"2016-05-16 16:45:15";"2016-08-12 15:50:52";NULL

Adebisi came to the UK from Nigeria in 2004. She was in the last trimester of pregnancy and had being advised by doctors that she would have to deliver by caesarian section due to complications.  She expressed that she was fearful to undergo the procedure in Nigeria, so she came to the UK to undergo the operation instead.   It was during an antenatal checkup that it was discovered that she had HIV and her unborn child would also be HIV positive, due to the late diagnosis and lack of treatment.  In Nigeria Adebisi was a successful business woman who owned her own business selling textiles and employed 10 people.  Adebisi has two children aged 14 and 11 years of age, the eldest child is HIV positive.HealthAdebisi was diagnosed with HIV in 2004, due to the shock of diagnosis, she stopped eating and had bouts of incessant crying and then succumbed to a mild stroke due to the.  She also suffers from blood pressure, insomnia and high cholesterol which are the side effects of HIV medication.  She expressed that she also suffer from depression which she feels is due to not being able to work, something which she is used to doing.

He lives with his wife (main carer) and his adopted granddaughter aged 10 years. Mr Mitchell is cared for 24/7 by his wife who has to complete all tasks with him. He cannot prepare any food as he struggles to retain information such as descriptions of items, where to find items in a kitchen, how to use even simple equipment such as kettle, has no awareness to danger or risks. His short term memory is so impaired that he is not able to remember what he has asked for. Mr Mitchells diagnosis is deteriorating rapidly and he has physical symptoms such as tremors and epilepsy which affect any task. Mr Mitchell cannot describe what he wants to eat and his carer chooses meals for him. He eats with a spoon as he cannot manage to hold his knife or fork and on occasion needs to be assisted to eat. Mr Mitchell has significant cognitive impairment as a result of his diagnosis and as a result needs constant supervision with all daily living tasks. For example he cannot answer telephone calls as he cannot remember the information needed to answer questions, he cannot manage clinical/health appointments as his wife has to do this. Mr Mitchell is not orientated to the day, date and time and is easily upset and frustrated when he cannot recall information. He can experience poor sleep as a result of his epilepsy episodes and can be extremely unstable when trying to mobilise and is prone to regular falls because of fatigue, poor balance, inability to judge depth perception and as a result of his diagnosis and tremors cannot control his movements well. Mr Mitchell is experiencing great difficulty with bathing and is being assessed by our Occupational Therapy Service to find equipment and consider the installation of a wet room for safety and as a result of his weakness and instability. Mr Mitchell is experiencing bouts of urinary incontinence and is struggling to mobilise to the toilet at times of need. Often as a result of his epilepsy he is urinary incontinent and this is having a significant impact on his mental health and well-being. Mr Mitchell tends to be withdrawn and introvert as a result of this incontinence and will reject trying to do any activity as he worries that he will have incontinence and be stigmatised. Mr Mitchell cannot independently get dressed or undressed as he struggles with motor skills and cannot coordinate his limbs to put on shirts or trousers for example. Mr Mitchell needs the constant help of his wife to do these tasks as he becomes distressed when attempting them. Mr Mitchell has no awareness to what clothes to wear on what days and would be inappropriately dressed on most days. Mr Mitchell's body temperature is often cold and this is believed to be a resulting impact of his vascular problems and brain injury. Mr Mitchell struggles to communicate especially around people he has never met before. He has a set of stock responses to questions and can be cyclical in his conversations. Mr Mitchell cannot read and understand words as he has lost the retention of information and needs his wife to do this for him and answer correspondence. Mrs Mitchell is his appointee and handles all of his affairs including finances. Mr Mitchell cannot calculate monies or work out his change and cannot remember security information or a pin number. Mrs Mitchell has to do this for him. Mr Mitchell cannot follow instructions or use even simple equipment such as a kettle. He is very unaware of risks and would injure himself easily if he tried to make a cup of tea. He could not even follow this sequence and then becomes very agitated and angry when he cannot do tasks. Mr Mitchell is a warm individual who tries hard to please others and would be extremely vulnerable if he did not have the 24/7 support of his wife. Mr Mitchell as described is cyclical in his conversation and sticks to a set number of responses but cannot answer questions. He defaults to his wife for help to answer when he cannot remember. Mr Mitchell cannot travel anywhere without assistance as he has no orientation to time, date, day or place. Mr Mitchell is vulnerable when outside his home and needs constant supervision to ensure his personal safety. Mr Mitchell cannot stand independently without some form of equipment. He is prone to falls and has very poor balance and coordination. His wife needs to guide him by the arm, explain the road surface to him and advise him how to move and step up or down from kerbs. Mr Mitchell is now blind in one eye. I have worked with the Mitchell family since March 2015 and have seen a significant decline in his physical and mental well-being. Mr Mitchell has care 24/7 from his wife who is his main carer because he cannot tolerate new faces or people acting with him to complete personal care tasks. Mr Mitchell is managing to stay at home with the support of his wife and if this situation were to break down he would need to be accommodate in a residential care setting as his needs are critical and involve a 24/7 care plan.

Susan is in desperate need of a bed as currently she is sleeping on her grandsons old mattress which is on the floor. This situation is not ideal due to her slipped disc, the mattress does not offer her any support and because it is so low she struggles to get in and out of bed.";"2016-06-30 15:16:36";"2016-08-15 09:46:33";"1471250793"

She was diagnosed with HIV when she was 17, in the 1980s, after contracting the virus from her first boyfriend. At that time she was given no more than 5 years life expectancy, due to the lack of viable medications. Obviously this had a terrible impact on Rosa’s late teenage years as she was suddenly facing a potential fatal illness, along with the stigma associated with HIV & AIDS.She worked as a waitress in Spain and also volunteered supporting people with AIDS during the terminal phase of their illness. In the space of a few years she lost all of her friends due to AIDS.She came to London in 1995, to study English and because she wanted to travel. She worked as a chambermaid in a hotel and also at McDonalds as her salary was very low.Unfortunately she then became ill and was given TB treatment before she started on anti HIV medications. She had to stop working as she was too weak and her immune system was very weak.Since then she has been on many different combinations of anti HIV medication and has suffered from a lot of different side effects, particularly in the earlier years.More recently Rosa has been diagnosed with cancer, and is now struggling with the treatment and its side effects.Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy and HIV medications have left Rosa with mobility problems – she suffers from arthritis, peripheral neuropathy (damage to nerve endings) and lower back problems. In addition she is more prone to fractures on the sacral bone; suffers from faecal incontinence, which causes her a lot of distress; night sweats, fatigue and lack of energy. She also has to take a lot of pain killers and other medication to treat her incontinence and fatigue.Rosa also suffers from vertigo migraines, which are very debilitating and takes medication to try to control them. She has had to endure a lot of pain before the cancer diagnosis due to endometriosis and fibroids and underwent surgery to remove the fibroids and cysts.As a result of the pelvic radiotherapy her periods have stopped and she has gone into early stage menopause, which means she is also having to deal with the additional symptoms and stress related to that, as well as starting Hormone Replacement Therapy in order to protect her bones and the elevated risk of fracture.Dealing with all of this has had a great impact on Rosa’s psychological well-being. She suffers from depression and anxiety for which she takes additional medication. However, despite all of this she does make a real effort to contribute to society whenever she can as she feels that society has helped her a lot. She has continued to volunteer for a number of HIV support charities, including Positively UK, Terrence Higgins Trust and Cara Trust. She has been living with HIV for nearly 30 years, so she tries to use her knowledge and experience to help others.Rosa needs a new washing machine as her current one is old, faulty and constantly leaks. Because of some of her symptoms, night sweats and incontinence, she needs to use the machine at least once each day, so a new machine would be really beneficial for her.She also needs a new double mattress as her existing one is very old and worn. She would really benefit from a new one as she spends a lot of time in bed as a result of her back pains, neuropathy, arthritis and fatigue. ";"2016-07-06 15:31:04";"2016-08-22 16:43:20";"1471880600"

Her niece advised her to go to the hospital for a check-up. Ruth told the doctors to check everything including HIV. The doctors advised her to come back in for the results in three weeks. When she went back for results, she was told that she is HIV positive. She felt shocked and sad at the news. she was advised by the doctors to start taking medication of which she did. The first medication they gave her had a lot of side effects which were unbearable, so they decided to change it and give her a new one, which is still giving her some side effects. In 2004, Ruth applied to the Home Office, for a Compassionate leave to Remain in UK. After a year in 2005, her application was turned down. She decided to appeal against the decision and again the appeal was turned down. She then decided to continue seeking help and she went for legal aid with UK Border Agency for more support and to ask them how she can be allowed to stay in the country while she is receiving HIV medication. She was asked to send her photographs, of which she did, but they never replied her. In 2014, Ruth decided to make another application to the Home Office and in June 2015 they replied her, again turning down her application. In the same year, she decided to put in another new application and she is still waiting for the decision.";"2016-07-19 11:25:51";"2016-08-22 16:46:20";"1471880780"

She has no savings and she is on a low income made up of attendance allowance, pension credit and a small state pension. She is single and lives alone. In September 2015 this 84 year old lady was diagnosed with angiosarcoma of the abdominal wall, since then, her disease has progressed and she also has lymphodema. She has great difficulty getting around and needs help. It causes her discomfort to walk around. She has become confined to her home and this has caused her to feel very down, isolated and depressed. Mary would greatly benefit from a Mobility Scooter as it would allow her to get out of the house and improve her mental health and well being. A family member borrowed a mobility scooter to check that she would be able to use one and she was able to do so with ease. Mary would be grateful if mobility trust could help her buy a mobility scooter as she has been quoted £1400 for a new one. I am helping her to explore all sources of funding and any help would be greatly appreciated. Her condition is now palliative";"2016-07-22 12:26:01";"2016-08-15 10:18:36";"1471252716"

Christine suffers from multiple health conditions which affect her ability to carry out day to day activities easily. The reason for the request to this fund is to enable Christine to manage in her home more easily. Christine has had a number of operations on her pelvis in the past so experiences daily pain when she moves. She is unable to stand for long periods of time without pain so needs to regularly take rests to sit down. In addition to this Christine also experiences pain in her hands and elbow meaning it is difficult for her to carry out some household tasks. Christine’s Fibromyalgia also means that she suffers with extreme tiredness and has to take regular naps throughout the day. Her mental health adds on top of this pressure as she can struggle to find the motivation to start the day and tasks that are needed. I am applying to the fund to request funds to go towards a dishwasher for Christine. Although she is aware that this is a non priority item, she feels as that this would greatly improve her quality of life and is priority for her. Currently she has to wash up in stages and often takes days to wash only a few items. If she were to have a dishwasher she would be able to load one item at a time after she had used it which she would find a lot easier. Christine does have a good level of income coming in however this is being diminished at a quicker rate than normal as she has recently moved into a new property. She has had a lot of outgoings to pay and still has items such as carpets to buy for her home meaning she is unable to save up for a dishwasher herself. Thank you for taking the time to consider this application.

Stephanie suffers with significant degenerative cervical spine disease. She has narrowing of the spinal canal which is compressing the spinal cord and has caused irreversible damage. She had an operation to relieve pressure on the top of her spinal cord but has only prevented further deterioration and has not improved her overall level of pain. She has been told she will probably need an operation on her lower back in 3-4 years as the deterioration in her lower spine gets worse. We have assisted Stephanie with a new claim for Personal Independence Payment. She requires a specialist mattress as hers causes her pain and discomfort. She regularly wakes up at around 2:00am as she is in pain. Stephanie has a quote from a company named 'Bruno' for £675. Their mattress' are designed to keep your spine straight and will be much better for our her back. Stephanie has been granted £500 from the City of Oxford Charity on the condition we can raise the rest of the money for the mattress. We have advised Stephanie about claiming ESA but she has not yet made an application.

Therefore, she does not have any type of income. She relies on her friend’s goodwill and help. She also relies on food banks and transport money from charities.BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CASE-Miss Yusuf was born in Nigeria. She arrived in the UK in 2008 as a visitor and stayed with a friend.-Adejoke got very sick in 2008 before her visa expired. She was taken to A&E when she collapsed and her legs were bleeding. She was then diagnosed then HIV +. She was in hospital for 3 months and it was not until March 2009 that she was released. -Adejoke started HIV treatment in 2008 and has gone through different treatment combinations. -Miss Yusuf was diagnosed with kidney problems in 2008 and since then has been undertaking dialysis 3 days a week.  -Adejoke suffers from a lot side effects from her HIV treatment and from the dialysis. She gets breathless very easily and has a lot of fatigue.  She reports how many occasions she has collapsed on her way home from dialysis as she is too exhausted and has no money to take a taxi to get home.  She is so exhausted when she arrives home that she has to go straight to bed to rest. -Adejoke also suffers from very high blood pressure and has to take medication for it.-Miss Yusuf applied twice for asylum but both applications were refused.  Until February 2016 she was getting some help as an asylum seeker but the payment stopped then.-Miss Yusuf would like to apply again but she has no money and finds herself very frustrated at her whole situation.-Adejoke feels emotionally stressed and depressed as her health situation is very delicate and she is so exhausted that she can’t do anything; her immigration status is not solved and she does not have any money to buy food, clothes nor toiletries. WHAT IS NEEDED AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH “POVERTY” IS INVOLVEDMiss Yusuf needs money to buy food as she does not have recourse to public funds; being HIV positive and going 3 days a week for dialysis puts her in a more vulnerable position. It is crucial for her to have a proper diet in order for her health not to deteriorate even further.-She also needs money for clothes, as suffering from an immune depressed illness (HIV) and kidney disease makes her more vulnerable to get colds which could develop into more serious conditions such as pneumonia.  -Miss Yusuf also needs toiletries. Maintaining good hygiene is essential in order not to get any bacterial infections which for people with HIV and on dialysis could be devastating for their health.";"2016-08-24 15:35:21";"2016-11-02 13:59:53";"1478095193"

Jane has been diagnosed with Advanced HIV infection and is receiving treatment from Dr Ian Cropley from the Royal Free Hospital. Jane works part time under a zero hour contract, so her income varies as her employer is not obliged to provide her with any working hours.  Consequently, the figures included in this form are just a guideline based on her receiving regular work of 16 hours per week, as some weeks she may not receive any work at all, which puts a big strain on her finances. Jane has multiple debts and is struggling financially. She owes in excess of £10,000 in debt and is currently paying £27.53 per week towards repayments. Enforcement action has been taken against her by Council Tax and her landlord took her to court for rent arrears in April 2016, an agreement was reached at court requiring her to pay £6.00 per week towards the arrears. Jane has advised that her Dr is concerned about her condition as stress and anxiety due to debt recovery action could lead to deterioration in her medical condition. Details of her debts have been listed as follows: 1. £4756.33 owed on her rent, she is currently paying £6.00 per week2. £1422.40 owed on her council tax. She is paying £9.23 per week towards the current council tax and the arrears. 3. £836.62 owed to Affinity Water, she is currently paying £10 per week4. £2525.80 owed to Provident, she is currently paying £2.31 per week5. £800 owed to Barclaycard, she is currently paying £2.31 per week6. £654.61 per week owed to Credit Union, she is currently paying £1.15 per week	Jane is in need of a new bed with mattress and bedding as her previous bed broke, and due to her low income she was unable to replace it.  For the last  year she has been sleeping on a mattress on the floor, which is very uncomfortable. The client is currently taking a lot of medication to treat her condition. She has informed us that the side effects of the medication make her very tired and she gets aches in her joints, so a new bed is essential, so that she can sleep comfortably which will aid her health and wellbeing.

Veronica returned to the UK after being deported from the USA.  She was born in London in 1962 and immigrated to the USA with her father, she does not know the whereabouts of her mother.  She first lived in Brooklyn N.Y before moving to Long Island and then finally her father settled in Miami. She expressed that throughout her childhood she suffered from anxiety attacks.  At the age of 14 she was introduced to alcohol and marijuana whilst at school.  At 19 years of age she met her first serious boyfriend who introduced her to Crack Cocaine and her life deteriorated from there.  She moved back to NY where she entered into a life of prostitution, which she was eventually jailed for, and drug addiction.  Veronica has been abstinent from alcohol and drugs for over 9 years now, something which she is rightly proud of.After being deported back to the UK, she was housed by the Borough of Wandsworth for 3 years until the landlord decided that he wanted his property back.  This resulted in her being housed in different locations around the country, Southampton, London and Folkstone  to name a few, until she eventually ended up in Leeds, where she was a victim of racial abuse and physical violence on two separate occasions which were both reported to the police.   She is estranged from her family in London and is very socially isolated without any peer or community support.  HealthVeronica was diagnosed with HIV in 2005 and also suffers from Fibroids, Sciatica, Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Asthma and has an historical diagnosis of depression and anxiety, and unfortunately the instability in her home life has caused her mental health to deteriorate further.  She also has a history of self-harming although the last time was in May of this year.NeedI made a visit to Veronica as she was unable to come into our office as she suffers from mobility issues due to sciatica.  On entering her property I was immediately faced with the starkness of her flat.  She is sleeping on the floor with a sleeping blanket, and has nothing else.   Due to a lack of cooking utensils she is forced to eat unhealthy takeaways.  She has been housed by in a long term temporary accommodation flat, which was given to her unfurnished, apart from a cooker.  Unfortunately she had to leave the few belongings which she owned when she fled Leeds due to racial violence.Veronica is in need of the following items:BedFridgePlatesTableBeddingCutleryChest of DrawersBath matMicrowaveI am requesting £200 to purchase Bedding, Cutlery, Bath Mats and PlatesPlease make any cheques payable to The Cara Trust.Kindest regardFiona ReidSocial Worker";"2016-11-11 17:12:15";"2016-12-02 16:24:39";"1480695879"

I work for Outreach Barnet, which is a support service jointly run by Genesis Housing Association and Homeless Action Barnet, which all have charitable status.Ms Bumpus is a 44 year old, severely disabled female suffering from ME, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She is also allergic to certain foods and dust. She is currently in receipt of higher rate Disability Living Allowance for mobility and care and has a 22.5 hour a week care package, which was put in place by Barnet Adult Social Care. This supports her with cooking, cleaning and personal care. She lives in a fully adapted bungalow, and is largely housebound. Julia uses a wheelchair and on the rare occasions when she is well enough to venture outside. Ms Bumpus lives alone and is quite isolated due to her medical condition and she is very restricted with respect to social activities. She is extremely proactive in trying hard to improve her condition but she is very limited in what she is able to accomplish. For example, having a shower can totally deplete her energy. I believe that she would find a recuperative break extremely beneficial as it would help her to better manage her physical health and give her Access to facilities she would not normally be able to have use of, such as hydrotherapy, specialist dieticians, counselling and spiritual and emotional support. Ms Bumpus uses her electric wheelchair to explore the beautiful grounds at Burrswood Hospital, which she thoroughly enjoys as she used to do a lot of hill walking. As well as this it would give her a chance to socialise with other individuals in similar circumstances to herself and form friendships.Burrswood Hospital is the only respite centre in the country, which specialises in CFS and as such seems the best respite care for Ms Bumpus. She would greatly benefit from having a respite break away from home, as it would allow her to energise herself and have something to look forward to. Ms Bumpus is requesting for 14 days respite care, as it can take Ms Bumpus 2-3 days to fully recover from a long journey, so that would give her 10 days to make full use of the facilities. The cost of the break would be £2065 per week, and Ms Bumpus is requesting funding towards the second part of the week, as the first part of the week is covered.I appreciate any assistance you can give to support Ms. Bumpus with Burrswood Hospital.";"2016-09-26 16:07:22";"2016-10-14 12:11:59";"1476443519"

Alongside this mum is full time career for her daughter and is restricted regarding finding work which is something she would like to be able to do in order to make their home a more confrotable and relaxing environment for her daughter.";"2016-10-26 14:22:42";"2016-11-09 10:42:30";"1478688150"

Veronica suffers from Cystic Fibrosis.Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the UK’s most common life limiting inherited condition. The condition is complex and progressive with many debilitating secondary symptoms. Cystic Fibrosis affects the mucus producing glands of the body, mainly the lungs and pancreas causing malnutrition and chest infections that result in permanent lung damage. The progression of the disease can create further problems as it affects additional organs. A permanent, distinctive cough which disrupts sleep, tiredness and excessive sweating are also common characteristics of the condition. There is no cure for Cystic Fibrosis.Veronica requires am intensive daily treatment regime that is designed to slow the inevitable progression of the disease. This includes physiotherapy to clear thick mucus from her lungs, oral and nebulised medications to help minimise chest infections and to treat those when they occur and a special high fat and protein diet with additional vitamin supplementation and Pancreatic enzymes with all food to aid digestion to help minimise weight loss. It is a very physically demanding routine to follow every day in life. This demanding routine puts additional pressure on Veronica who has for some time been providing care on a daily basis to her elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimer’s. Veronica has not had any form of respite for a number of years and would greatly benefit from some time away to rest and recuperate. She would only be able to take a short break due to the care needs of her mother and therefore we would be seeking a long weekend or similar.Our aim is to ensure people with this serious condition have access to resources that will enable them to have optimum care, including respite holidays where appropriate. Consequently we strongly support this application. If I can provide any further information that would assist your decision please do not hesitate to contact me. Meanwhile thank you for considering my request and I look forward to hearing from you.Yours SincerelyMichael Sinclair";"2016-10-27 11:51:46";"2016-11-17 11:57:49";"1479383869"

Chika now has right to remain in the UK in her own right but this came 3 weeks after she resumed her studies at year one again. I tried for months to see if she could be granted a bursary, however this was granted . The only way she can get an NHS Bursary would be start her course again at year one.

Chika lives for her Nursing course and remains to both beat cancer and become a qualified nurse.  Seh has rented a second home to cut down travelling backwards and forwards to London each day but goes home each weekend to see her mother. Her costs leave her very little money left over.

As this was the second time the flat had been flooded they were unable to get contents insurance and lost around £25,000.00 worth of belongings and have relied heavily on the generosity of friends, family and local businesses who donated a sofa, chairs, kitchen equipment and bedding.  I applied to the Cumbria Community Foundation who kindly gave them a grant of £4,000 which paid for clothes, small electrical items, practical house hold items and carpets.  The RL Glasspool and Independence at Home have very kindly replaced their washing machine and tumble dryer.  Rachael has a hearing loss and relies on two hearing aids.  Part of Saskia’s disability means that can very often display challenging behaviour if she is not the centre of Rachael’s attention and will shout and wail loudly, this behaviour is displayed if Rachael is on the phone and she struggles to hear and hold a conversation, the BT 4500 phone is hearing aid compatible as it has a built in inductive coupler, and Rachael really misses this and would very much like to replace it and therefore, I write to ask if the Margaret’s fund would grant £79.49 to allow her to purchase thisExpenditure – Rachael pays £70 a week to her son, as her other daughter lives with him through the week whilst she is at college in Wigan.

This went on for years and 15month ago Stacey returned to her mum's house.Recently Stacey discovered she was pregnant and due to give birth in June 2017 hence why Stacey applied to us for her own property a few months ago and she successfully got her own 1 bedroom unfurnished flat. Living at home with mum and sister in an overcrowded house was not an option for Stacey with the discovery of her having a baby.Stacey's worked hard and with help from friends and family managed to obtain some items. As her landlord we have provided her with a fridge/freezer, so the only items she requires now is a washer. Having a washer will greatly improve her living conditions.";"2016-12-02 14:02:58";"2016-12-12 15:52:18";"1481557938"
